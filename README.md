This repository provides a **ready-to-import MySQL database containing the text of the Holy Quran** for developers who need a reliable, structured Quran dataset.

The database includes:

- Arabic Quran text **with Tashkeel (diacritics)**  
- Arabic Quran text **without Tashkeel (plain)**  
- Optional English translations of meaning (separate SQL files)

This project allows teams to integrate Quran data into websites, mobile apps, research tools, and educational platforms **without building the database layer from scratch**.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to help teams integrate the Holy Quran text into their infrastructure quickly and consistently.

The project is released under the **MIT License**, allowing usage in both commercial and non-commercial applications.

---

## Recognition

Resource files used to generate this database are based on the **quran-layers** project by BigProf:

https://github.com/bigprof-software/quran-layers

Credit is given to the original authors for their work.

## What’s Included

The main file:

```
quranDB.sql
```

Contains two core tables:

---

### chapters Table

Stores Surah metadata:

- `id` – Surah number (1–114)  
- `arabic_name` – Arabic Surah name (Unicode)  
- `english_transliteration` – English transliteration of the Surah name  
- `english_translation` – English meaning of the Surah name  

> Expected rows: **114**

---

### verses Table

Stores each Ayah linked to its Surah:

- `id` – Auto-increment row ID  
- `chapter_id` – Surah number (FK → chapters.id)  
- `verse_number` – Ayah number within the Surah  
- `arabic_text_tashkeel` – Arabic text with diacritics  
- `arabic_text_plain` – Arabic text without diacritics  

---

### Translation SQL Files (`translations/`)

Each translation is provided as a separate SQL file.

Naming pattern:

```
translations/{translation_name}.sql
```

Each translation table contains:

- `id` – Auto-increment row ID  
- `chapter_id` – Surah number  
- `verse_number` – Ayah number  
- `english_text` – Translation of meaning  

Translations are optional and can be imported independently.

---

## Database Encoding

All Arabic text is stored using:

```
utf8mb4
```

This ensures correct preservation of Arabic characters and diacritics.

---
