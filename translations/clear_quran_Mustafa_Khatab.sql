(2, 7, 'Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous punishment.'),
(2, 8, 'And there are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” yet they are not &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(2, 9, 'They seek to deceive Allah and the believers, yet they only deceive themselves, but they fail to perceive it.'),
(2, 10, 'There is sickness in their hearts, and Allah &#761;only&#762; lets their sickness increase. They will suffer a painful punishment for their lies.'),
(2, 11, 'When they are told, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they reply, “We are only peace-makers!”'),
(2, 12, 'Indeed, it is they who are the corruptors, but they fail to perceive it.'),
(2, 13, 'And when they are told, “Believe as others believe,” they reply, “Will we believe as the fools believe?” Indeed, it is they who are fools, but they do not know.'),
(2, 14, 'When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when alone with their evil associates they say, “We are definitely with you; we were only mocking.”'),
(2, 15, 'Allah will throw their mockery back at them, leaving them to continue wandering blindly in their defiance.'),
(2, 16, 'They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance. But this trade is profitless, and they are not &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(2, 17, 'Their example is that of someone who kindles a fire, but when it lights up all around them, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in complete darkness—unable to see.'),
(2, 18, 'They are &#761;wilfully&#762; deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will never return &#761;to the Right Path&#762;.'),
(2, 19, 'Or &#761;those caught in&#762; a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers &#761;by His might&#762;.'),
(2, 20, 'It is as if the lightning were about to snatch away their sight. Whenever lightning strikes, they walk in its light, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and sight. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(2, 21, 'O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(2, 22, '&#761;He is the One&#762; Who has made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. So do not knowingly set up equals to Allah &#761;in worship&#762;.'),
(2, 23, 'And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.'),
(2, 24, 'But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.'),
(2, 25, 'Give good news &#761;O Prophet&#762; to those who believe and do good that they will have Gardens under which rivers flow. Whenever provided with fruit, they will say, “This is what we were given before,” for they will be served fruit that looks similar &#761;but tastes different&#762;. They will have pure spouses, and they will be there forever.'),
(2, 26, 'Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or what is even smaller. As for the believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue, “What does Allah mean by such a parable?” Through this &#761;test&#762;, He leaves many to stray, and guides many. And He leaves none to stray except the rebellious—'),
(2, 27, 'those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever &#761;ties&#762; Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the &#761;true&#762; losers.'),
(2, 28, 'How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.'),
(2, 29, 'He is the One Who created everything in the earth for you. Then He turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens. And He has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(2, 30, '&#761;Remember&#762; when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive &#761;human&#762; authority on earth.” They asked &#761;Allah&#762;, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.”'),
(2, 31, 'He taught Adam the names of all things, then He presented them to the angels and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if what you say is true?”'),
(2, 32, 'They replied, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are truly the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”'),
(2, 33, 'Allah said, “O Adam! Inform them of their names.” Then when Adam did, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”'),
(2, 34, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused and acted arrogantly, becoming unfaithful.'),
(2, 35, 'We cautioned, “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat as freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.”'),
(2, 36, 'But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the &#761;blissful&#762; state they were in, and We said, “Descend from the heavens &#761;to the earth&#762; as enemies to each other. You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.”'),
(2, 37, 'Then Adam was inspired with words &#761;of prayer&#762; by his Lord, so He accepted his repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 38, 'We said, “Descend all of you! Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows it, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 39, 'But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”'),
(2, 40, 'O children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your covenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me &#761;alone&#762;.'),
(2, 41, 'Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures. Do not be the first to deny them or trade them for a fleeting gain. And be mindful of Me.'),
(2, 42, 'Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly.'),
(2, 43, 'Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and bow down with those who bow down.'),
(2, 44, 'Do you preach righteousness and fail to practice it yourselves, although you read the Scripture? Do you not understand?'),
(2, 45, 'And seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, it is a burden except for the humble—'),
(2, 46, 'those who are certain that they will meet their Lord and to Him they will return.'),
(2, 47, 'O Children of Israel! Remember &#761;all&#762; the favours I granted you and how I honoured you above the others.'),
(2, 48, 'Guard yourselves against the Day on which no soul will be of help to another. No intercession will be accepted, no ransom taken, and no help will be given.'),
(2, 49, '&#761;Remember&#762; how We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.'),
(2, 50, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We parted the sea, rescued you, and drowned Pharaoh’s people before your very eyes.'),
(2, 51, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We appointed forty nights for Moses, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.'),
(2, 52, 'Even then We &#761;still&#762; forgave you so perhaps you would be grateful.'),
(2, 53, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We gave Moses the Scripture—the standard &#761;to distinguish between right and wrong&#762; that perhaps you would be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(2, 54, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Surely you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so turn in repentance to your Creator and execute &#761;the calf-worshippers among&#762; yourselves. That is best for you in the sight of your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 55, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when you said, “O Moses! We will never believe you until we see Allah with our own eyes,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.'),
(2, 56, 'Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that perhaps you would be grateful.'),
(2, 57, 'And &#761;remember when&#762; We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, &#761;saying&#762;, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” The evildoers &#761;certainly&#762; did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.'),
(2, 58, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We said, “Enter this city and eat freely from wherever you please; enter the gate with humility, saying, ‘Absolve us.’ We will forgive your sins and multiply the reward for the good-doers.”'),
(2, 59, 'But the wrongdoers changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their rebelliousness.'),
(2, 60, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out, &#761;and&#762; each tribe knew its drinking place. &#761;We then said,&#762; “Eat and drink of Allah’s provisions, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”'),
(2, 61, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when you said, “O Moses! We cannot endure the same meal &#761;every day&#762;. So &#761;just&#762; call upon your Lord on our behalf, He will bring forth for us some of what the earth produces of herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses scolded &#761;them&#762;, “Do you exchange what is better for what is worse? &#761;You can&#762; go down to any village and you will find what you have asked for.” They were stricken with disgrace and misery, and they invited the displeasure of Allah for rejecting Allah’s signs and unjustly killing the prophets. This is &#761;a fair reward&#762; for their disobedience and violations.'),
(2, 62, 'Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever &#761;truly&#762; believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 63, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We took a covenant from you and raised the mountain above you &#761;saying&#762;, “Hold firmly to that &#761;Scripture&#762; which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.”'),
(2, 64, 'Yet you turned away afterwards. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, you would have certainly been of the losers.'),
(2, 65, 'You are already aware of those of you who broke the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!”'),
(2, 66, 'So We made their fate an example to present and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing.'),
(2, 67, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.” They replied, “Are you mocking us?” Moses responded, “I seek refuge in Allah from acting foolishly!”'),
(2, 68, 'They said, “Call upon your Lord to clarify for us what type &#761;of cow&#762; it should be!” He replied, “Allah says, ‘The cow should neither be old nor young but in between. So do as you are commanded!’”'),
(2, 69, 'They said, “Call upon your Lord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a bright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’”'),
(2, 70, 'Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided &#761;to the right one&#762;.”'),
(2, 71, 'He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly!'),
(2, 72, '&#761;This is&#762; when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah revealed what you concealed.'),
(2, 73, 'So We instructed, “Strike the dead body with a piece of the cow.” This is how &#761;easily&#762; Allah brings the dead to life, showing you His signs so that you may understand.'),
(2, 74, 'Even then your hearts became hardened like a rock or even harder, for some rocks gush rivers; others split, spilling water; while others are humbled in awe of Allah. And Allah is never unaware of what you do.'),
(2, 75, 'Do you &#761;believers still&#762; expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it?'),
(2, 76, 'When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say &#761;to each other&#762;, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge Allah has revealed to you, so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?”'),
(2, 77, 'Do they not know that Allah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal?'),
(2, 78, 'And among them are the illiterate who know nothing about the Scripture except lies, and &#761;so&#762; they &#761;wishfully&#762; speculate.'),
(2, 79, 'So woe to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned.'),
(2, 80, '&#761;Some of&#762; the Jews claim, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Have you taken a pledge from Allah—for Allah never breaks His word—or are you &#761;just&#762; saying about Allah what you do not know?”'),
(2, 81, 'But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed in sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(2, 82, 'And those who believe and do good will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.'),
(2, 83, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We took a covenant from the children of Israel &#761;stating&#762;, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you &#761;Israelites&#762; turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.'),
(2, 84, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We took your covenant that you would neither shed each other’s blood nor expel each other from their homes, you gave your pledge and bore witness.'),
(2, 85, 'But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those &#761;expelled&#762; come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you. Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.'),
(2, 86, 'These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped.'),
(2, 87, 'Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive messengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. Why is it that every time a messenger comes to you &#761;Israelites&#762; with something you do not like, you become arrogant, rejecting some and killing others?'),
(2, 88, 'They say, “Our hearts are unreceptive!” In fact, Allah has condemned them for their disbelief. They have but little faith.'),
(2, 89, 'Although they used to pray for victory &#761;by means of the Prophet&#762; over the polytheists, when there came to them a Book from Allah which they recognized, confirming the Scripture they had &#761;in their hands&#762;, they rejected it. So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers.'),
(2, 90, 'Miserable is the price they have sold their souls for—denying Allah’s revelation and resenting Allah for granting His grace to whoever He wills of His servants! They have earned wrath upon wrath. And such disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment.'),
(2, 91, 'When it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Why then did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you are &#761;truly&#762; believers?”'),
(2, 92, 'Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.'),
(2, 93, 'And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you &#761;saying&#762;, “Hold firmly to that &#761;Scripture&#762; which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “How evil is what your &#761;so-called&#762; belief prompts you to do, if you &#761;actually&#762; believe &#761;in the Torah&#762;!”'),
(2, 94, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “If the &#761;eternal&#762; Home of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively for you &#761;Israelites&#762; out of all humanity, then wish for death if what you say is true!”'),
(2, 95, 'But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of the wrongdoers.'),
(2, 96, 'You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.'),
(2, 97, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he revealed this &#761;Quran&#762; to your heart by Allah’s Will, confirming what came before it—a guide and good news for the believers.”'),
(2, 98, 'Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, then &#761;let them know that&#762; Allah is certainly the enemy of the disbelievers.'),
(2, 99, 'Indeed, We have sent down to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; clear revelations. &#761;But&#762; none will deny them except the rebellious.'),
(2, 100, 'Why is it that every time they make a covenant, a group of them casts it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.'),
(2, 101, 'Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.'),
(2, 102, 'They &#761;instead&#762; followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon. The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test &#761;for you&#762;, so do not abandon &#761;your&#762; faith.” Yet people learned &#761;magic&#762; that caused a rift &#761;even&#762; between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew!'),
(2, 103, 'If only they were faithful and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!'),
(2, 104, 'O believers! Do not say, “Râ’ina.” But say, “Un&#7827;urna,” and listen &#761;attentively&#762;. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(2, 105, 'The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists would not want you to receive any blessing from your Lord, but Allah selects whoever He wills for His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.'),
(2, 106, 'If We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?'),
(2, 107, 'Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs &#761;only&#762; to Allah, and you have no guardian or helper besides Allah?'),
(2, 108, 'Or do you &#761;believers&#762; intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses was asked before? But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly strayed from the Right Way.'),
(2, 109, 'Many among the People of the Book wish they could turn you &#761;believers&#762; back to disbelief because of their envy, after the truth has been made clear to them. Pardon and bear with them until Allah delivers His decision. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(2, 110, 'Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will &#761;certainly&#762; find &#761;its reward&#762; with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(2, 111, 'The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Show &#761;me&#762; your proof if what you say is true.”'),
(2, 112, 'But no! Whoever submits themselves to Allah and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 113, 'The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on,” although both recite the Scriptures. And those &#761;pagans&#762; who have no knowledge say the same &#761;about people of faith&#762;. Surely Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their dispute.'),
(2, 114, 'Who does more wrong than those who prevent Allah’s Name from being mentioned in His places of worship and strive to destroy them? Such people have no right to enter these places except with fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.'),
(2, 115, 'To Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn you are facing &#761;towards&#762; Allah. Surely Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 116, 'They say, “Allah has offspring.” Glory be to Him! In fact, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth—all are subject to His Will.'),
(2, 117, '&#761;He is&#762; the Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is!'),
(2, 118, 'Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign would come to us!” The same was said by those who came before. Their hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made the signs clear for people of sure faith.'),
(2, 119, 'We have surely sent you with the truth &#761;O Prophet&#762; as a deliverer of good news and a warner. And you will not be accountable for the residents of the Hellfire.'),
(2, 120, 'Never will the Jews or Christians be pleased with you, until you follow their faith. Say, “Allah’s guidance is the only &#761;true&#762; guidance.” And if you were to follow their desires after &#761;all&#762; the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or help you against Allah.'),
(2, 121, 'Those We have given the Book follow it as it should be followed. It is they who &#761;truly&#762; believe in it. As for those who reject it, it is they who are the losers.'),
(2, 122, 'O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others.'),
(2, 123, 'And guard yourselves against the Day when no soul will be of any help to another. No ransom will be taken, no intercession accepted, and no help will be given.'),
(2, 124, '&#761;Remember&#762; when Abraham was tested by his Lord with &#761;certain&#762; commandments, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will certainly make you into a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my offspring?” Allah replied, “My covenant is not extended to the wrongdoers.”'),
(2, 125, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We made the Sacred House a centre and a sanctuary for the people &#761;saying&#762;, “&#761;You may&#762; take the standing-place of Abraham as a site of prayer.” And We entrusted Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who circle it, who meditate in it, and who bow and prostrate themselves &#761;in prayer&#762;.'),
(2, 126, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city &#761;of Mecca&#762; secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will condemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!”'),
(2, 127, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham raised the foundation of the House with Ishmael, &#761;both praying,&#762; “Our Lord! Accept &#761;this&#762; from us. You are indeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 128, 'Our Lord! Make us both &#761;fully&#762; submit to You and from our descendants a nation that will submit to you. Show us our rituals, and turn to us in grace. You are truly the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 129, 'Our Lord! Raise from among them a messenger who will recite to them Your revelations, teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. Indeed, You &#761;alone&#762; are the Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(2, 130, 'And who would reject the faith of Abraham except a fool! We certainly chose him in this life, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous.'),
(2, 131, 'When his Lord ordered him, “Submit &#761;to My Will&#762;,” he responded, “I submit to the Lord of all worlds.”'),
(2, 132, 'This was the advice of Abraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, &#761;saying&#762;, “Indeed, Allah has chosen for you this faith; so do not die except in &#761;a state of full&#762; submission.”'),
(2, 133, 'Or did you witness when death came to Jacob? He asked his children, “Who will you worship after my passing?” They replied, “We will &#761;continue to&#762; worship your God, the God of your forefathers—Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac—the One God. And to Him we &#761;all&#762; submit.”'),
(2, 134, 'That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.'),
(2, 135, 'The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.”'),
(2, 136, 'Say, &#761;O believers,&#762; “We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to Allah we all submit.”'),
(2, 137, 'So if they believe in what you believe, then they will indeed be &#761;rightly&#762; guided. But if they turn away, they are simply opposed &#761;to the truth&#762;. But Allah will spare you their evil. For He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 138, 'This is the &#761;natural&#762; Way of Allah. And who is better than Allah in ordaining a way? And we worship &#761;none but&#762; Him.'),
(2, 139, 'Say, “Would you dispute with us about Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. And we are devoted to Him &#761;alone&#762;.'),
(2, 140, 'Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants were all Jews or Christians?” Say, “Who is more knowledgeable: you or Allah?” Who does more wrong than those who hide the testimony they received from Allah? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.'),
(2, 141, 'That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.'),
(2, 142, 'The foolish among the people will ask, “Why did they turn away from the direction of prayer they used to face?” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “The east and west belong &#761;only&#762; to Allah. He guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.”'),
(2, 143, 'And so We have made you &#761;believers&#762; an upright community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those &#761;rightly&#762; guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your &#761;previous acts of&#762; faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.'),
(2, 144, 'Indeed, We see you &#761;O Prophet&#762; turning your face towards heaven. Now We will make you turn towards a direction &#761;of prayer&#762; that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque &#761;in Mecca&#762;—wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture certainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what they do.'),
(2, 145, 'Even if you were to bring every proof to the People of the Book, they would not accept your direction &#761;of prayer&#762;, nor would you accept theirs; nor would any of them accept the direction &#761;of prayer&#762; of another. And if you were to follow their desires after &#761;all&#762; the knowledge that has come to you, then you would certainly be one of the wrongdoers.'),
(2, 146, 'Those We have given the Scripture recognize this &#761;Prophet&#762; as they recognize their own children. Yet a group of them hides the truth knowingly.'),
(2, 147, '&#761;This is&#762; the truth from your Lord, so do not ever be one of those who doubt.'),
(2, 148, 'Everyone turns to their own direction &#761;of prayer&#762;. So compete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together &#761;for judgment&#762;. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(2, 149, 'Wherever you are &#761;O Prophet&#762;, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is certainly the truth from your Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what you &#761;all&#762; do.'),
(2, 150, 'Wherever you are &#761;O Prophet&#762;, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you &#761;believers&#762; are, face towards it, so that people will have no argument against you, except the wrongdoers among them. Do not fear them; fear Me, so that I may &#761;continue to&#762; perfect My favour upon you and so you may be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(2, 151, 'Since We have sent you a messenger from among yourselves—reciting to you Our revelations, purifying you, teaching you the Book and wisdom, and teaching you what you never knew—'),
(2, 152, 'remember Me; I will remember you. And thank Me, and never be ungrateful.'),
(2, 153, 'O believers! Seek comfort in patience and prayer. Allah is truly with those who are patient.'),
(2, 154, 'Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead—in fact, they are alive! But you do not perceive it.'),
(2, 155, 'We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure—'),
(2, 156, 'who, when faced with a disaster, say, “Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will &#761;all&#762; return.”'),
(2, 157, 'They are the ones who will receive Allah’s blessings and mercy. And it is they who are &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(2, 158, 'Indeed, &#761;the hills of&#762; &#7778;afa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or minor pilgrimage, let them walk between &#761;the two hills&#762;. And whoever does good willingly, Allah is truly Appreciative, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 159, 'Those who hide the clear proofs and guidance that We have revealed—after We made it clear for humanity in the Book—will be condemned by Allah and &#761;all&#762; those who condemn.'),
(2, 160, 'As for those who repent, mend their ways, and let the truth be known, they are the ones to whom I will turn &#761;in forgiveness&#762;, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 161, 'Surely those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers are condemned by Allah, the angels, and all of humanity.'),
(2, 162, 'They will be in Hell forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be delayed &#761;from it&#762;.'),
(2, 163, 'Your God is &#761;only&#762; One God. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 164, 'Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth; the alternation of the day and the night; the ships that sail the sea for the benefit of humanity; the rain sent down by Allah from the skies, reviving the earth after its death; the scattering of all kinds of creatures throughout; the shifting of the winds; and the clouds drifting between the heavens and the earth—&#761;in all of this&#762; are surely signs for people of understanding.'),
(2, 165, 'Still there are some who take others as Allah’s equal—they love them as they should love Allah—but the &#761;true&#762; believers love Allah even more. If only the wrongdoers could see the &#761;horrible&#762; punishment &#761;awaiting them&#762;, they would certainly realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.'),
(2, 166, '&#761;Consider the Day&#762; when those who misled others will disown their followers—when they face the torment—and the bonds that united them will be cut off.'),
(2, 167, 'The &#761;misled&#762; followers will cry, “If only we could have a second chance, we would disown them as they disowned us.” And so Allah will make them remorseful of their misdeeds. And they will never &#761;be able to&#762; leave the Fire.'),
(2, 168, 'O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy.'),
(2, 169, 'He only incites you to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against Allah what you do not know.'),
(2, 170, 'When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “No! We &#761;only&#762; follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” &#761;Would they still do so,&#762; even if their forefathers had &#761;absolutely&#762; no understanding or guidance?'),
(2, 171, 'The example of the disbelievers &#761;not responding to the Messenger’s warning&#762; is like a flock not comprehending the calls and cries of the shepherd. &#761;They are wilfully&#762; deaf, dumb and blind so they have no understanding.'),
(2, 172, 'O believers! Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And give thanks to Allah if you &#761;truly&#762; worship Him &#761;alone&#762;.'),
(2, 173, 'He has only forbidden you &#761;to eat&#762; carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—they will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 174, 'Indeed, those who hide Allah’s revelations, trading them for a fleeting gain consume nothing but fire into their bellies. Allah will neither speak to them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. And they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(2, 175, 'They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How persistent are they in pursuit of the Fire!'),
(2, 176, 'That is because Allah has revealed the Book in truth. And surely those who differ regarding it are totally engrossed in opposition.'),
(2, 177, 'Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, &#761;needy&#762; travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in &#761;the heat of&#762; battle. It is they who are true &#761;in faith&#762;, and it is they who are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(2, 178, 'O believers! &#761;The law of&#762; retaliation is set for you in cases of murder—a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(2, 179, 'There is &#761;security of&#762; life for you in &#761;the law of&#762; retaliation, O people of reason, so that you may become mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(2, 180, 'It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you—if they leave something of value—a will should be made in favour of parents and immediate family with fairness. &#761;This is&#762; an obligation on those who are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(2, 181, 'But whoever changes the will after hearing it, the blame will only be on those who made the change. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 182, 'Whoever suspects an error or an injustice in the will and brings about a &#761;fair&#762; settlement among the parties will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 183, 'O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you—as it was for those before you—so perhaps you will become mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(2, 184, '&#761;Fast a&#762; prescribed number of days. But whoever of you is ill or on a journey, then &#761;let them fast&#762; an equal number of days &#761;after Rama&#7693;ân&#762;. For those who can only fast with extreme difficulty, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person &#761;for every day not fasted&#762;. But whoever volunteers to give more, it is better for them. And to fast is better for you, if only you knew.'),
(2, 185, 'Rama&#7693;ân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard &#761;to distinguish between right and wrong&#762;. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then &#761;let them fast&#762; an equal number of days &#761;after Rama&#7693;ân&#762;. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(2, 186, 'When My servants ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about Me: I am truly near. I respond to one’s prayer when they call upon Me. So let them respond &#761;with obedience&#762; to Me and believe in Me, perhaps they will be guided &#761;to the Right Way&#762;.'),
(2, 187, 'It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives during the nights preceding the fast. Your spouses are a garment for you as you are for them. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves. So He has accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may be intimate with them and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. &#761;You may&#762; eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to people, so they may become mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(2, 188, 'Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly, nor deliberately bribe authorities in order to devour a portion of others’ property, knowing that it is a sin.'),
(2, 189, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” Righteousness is not in entering your houses from the back doors. Rather, righteousness is to be mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;. So enter your homes through their &#761;proper&#762; doors, and be mindful of Allah so you may be successful.'),
(2, 190, 'Fight in the cause of Allah &#761;only&#762; against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Surely Allah does not like transgressors.'),
(2, 191, 'Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is the reward of the disbelievers.'),
(2, 192, 'But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 193, 'Fight against them &#761;if they persecute you&#762; until there is no more persecution, and &#761;your&#762; devotion will be to Allah &#761;alone&#762;. If they stop &#761;persecuting you&#762;, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.'),
(2, 194, '&#761;There will be retaliation in&#762; a sacred month for &#761;an offence in&#762; a sacred month, and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone attacks you, retaliate in the same manner. &#761;But&#762; be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with those mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(2, 195, 'Spend in the cause of Allah and do not let your own hands throw you into destruction &#761;by withholding&#762;. And do good, for Allah certainly loves the good-doers.'),
(2, 196, 'Complete the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage for Allah. But if prevented &#761;from proceeding&#762;, then &#761;offer&#762; whatever sacrificial animals you can afford. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its destination. But if any of you is ill or has a scalp ailment &#761;requiring shaving&#762;, then compensate either by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering. In times of peace, you may combine the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage then make the sacrificial offering you can afford. Whoever cannot afford that &#761;offering&#762;, let them fast three days during pilgrimage and seven after returning &#761;home&#762;—completing ten. These offerings are for those who do not live near the Sacred House. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.'),
(2, 197, '&#761;Commitment to&#762; pilgrimage is made in appointed months. Whoever commits to &#761;performing&#762; pilgrimage, let them stay away from intimate relations, foul language, and arguments during pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows of it. Take &#761;necessary&#762; provisions &#761;for the journey&#762;—surely the best provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O people of reason!'),
(2, 198, 'There is no blame on you for seeking the bounty of your Lord &#761;during this journey&#762;. When you return from ’Arafât, praise Allah near the sacred place and praise Him for having guided you, for surely before this &#761;guidance&#762; you were astray.'),
(2, 199, 'Then go forth with the rest of the pilgrims. And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 200, 'When you have fulfilled your sacred rites, praise Allah as you used to praise your forefathers &#761;before Islam&#762;, or even more passionately. There are some who say, “Our Lord! Grant us &#761;Your bounties&#762; in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter.'),
(2, 201, 'Yet there are others who say, “Our Lord! Grant us the good of this world and the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.”'),
(2, 202, 'It is they who will receive a &#761;heavenly&#762; reward for the good they have done. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.'),
(2, 203, 'And remember Allah during &#761;these&#762; appointed days. Whoever departs swiftly on the second day is not sinful, neither are those who stay behind &#761;till the third—seeking additional reward&#762;, so long as they are mindful &#761;of their Lord&#762;. And be mindful of Allah, and know that to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be gathered.'),
(2, 204, 'There are some &#761;hypocrites&#762; who impress you with their views regarding worldly affairs and openly call upon Allah to witness what is in their hearts, yet they are your worst adversaries.'),
(2, 205, 'And when they leave &#761;you&#762;, they strive throughout the land to spread mischief in it and destroy crops and cattle. Allah does not like mischief.'),
(2, 206, 'When it is said to them, “Fear Allah,” pride carries them off to sin. Hell will be their proper place. What an evil place to rest!'),
(2, 207, 'And there are those who would dedicate their lives to Allah’s pleasure. And Allah is Ever Gracious to &#761;His&#762; servants.'),
(2, 208, 'O believers! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. Surely he is your sworn enemy.'),
(2, 209, 'If you falter after receiving the clear proofs, then know that Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(2, 210, 'Are they waiting for Allah &#761;Himself&#762; to come to them in the shade of clouds, along with the angels? &#761;If He did&#762;, then the matter would be settled &#761;at once&#762;. And to Allah &#761;all&#762; matters will be returned &#761;for judgment&#762;.'),
(2, 211, 'Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. And whoever trades Allah’s favour—after receiving it—&#761;for disbelief&#762; should know that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.'),
(2, 212, 'The life of this world has been made appealing to the disbelievers, and they mock the believers. Those who are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; will rank above them on the Day of Judgment. And Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit.'),
(2, 213, 'Humanity had once been one community &#761;of believers before they lost faith&#762;. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.'),
(2, 214, 'Do you think you will be admitted into Paradise without being tested like those before you? They were afflicted with suffering and adversity and were so &#761;violently&#762; shaken that &#761;even&#762; the Messenger and the believers with him cried out, “When will Allah’s help come?” Indeed, Allah’s help is &#761;always&#762; near.'),
(2, 215, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet in&#762; what &#761;way&#762; they should donate. Say, “Whatever donations you give are for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and &#761;needy&#762; travellers. Whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.”'),
(2, 216, 'Fighting has been made obligatory upon you &#761;believers&#762;, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.'),
(2, 217, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about fighting in the sacred months. Say, “Fighting during these months is a great sin. But hindering &#761;others&#762; from the Path of Allah, rejecting Him, and expelling the worshippers from the Sacred Mosque is &#761;a&#762; greater &#761;sin&#762; in the sight of Allah. For persecution is far worse than killing. And they will not stop fighting you until they turn you away from your faith—if they can. And whoever among you renounces their own faith and dies a disbeliever, their deeds will become void in this life and in the Hereafter. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”'),
(2, 218, 'Surely those who have believed, emigrated, and struggled in the Way of Allah—they can hope for Allah’s mercy. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 219, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “There is great evil in both, as well as some benefit for people—but the evil outweighs the benefit.” They &#761;also&#762; ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; what they should donate. Say, “Whatever you can spare.” This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you &#761;believers&#762;, so perhaps you may reflect'),
(2, 220, 'upon this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; concerning orphans. Say, “Improving their condition is best. And if you partner with them, they are bonded with you &#761;in faith&#762;. And Allah knows who intends harm and who intends good. Had Allah willed, He could have made it difficult for you. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(2, 221, 'Do not marry polytheistic women until they believe; for a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may look pleasant to you. And do not marry your women to polytheistic men until they believe, for a believing slave-man is better than a free polytheist, even though he may look pleasant to you. They invite &#761;you&#762; to the Fire while Allah invites &#761;you&#762; to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace. He makes His revelations clear to the people so perhaps they will be mindful.'),
(2, 222, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about menstruation. Say, “Beware of its harm! So keep away, and do not have intercourse with your wives during their monthly cycles until they are purified. When they purify themselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by Allah. Surely Allah loves those who always turn to Him in repentance and those who purify themselves.”'),
(2, 223, 'Your wives are like farmland for you, so approach them &#761;consensually&#762; as you please. And send forth something good for yourselves. Be mindful of Allah, and know that you will meet Him. And give good news to the believers.'),
(2, 224, 'Do not use Allah’s Name in your oaths as an excuse for not doing good, not guarding against evil, or not making peace between people. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 225, 'Allah will not hold you accountable for unintentional oaths, but for what you intended in your hearts. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.'),
(2, 226, 'Those who swear not to have intercourse with their wives must wait for four months. If they change their mind, then Allah is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(2, 227, 'But if they settle on divorce, then Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 228, 'Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles &#761;before they can re-marry&#762;. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they &#761;truly&#762; believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree &#761;of responsibility&#762; above them. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(2, 229, 'Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain &#761;his wife&#762; with honour or separate &#761;from her&#762; with grace. It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah. So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the &#761;true&#762; wrongdoers.'),
(2, 230, 'So if a husband divorces his wife &#761;three times&#762;, then it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is divorced. Then it is permissible for them to reunite, as long as they feel they are able to maintain the limits of Allah. These are the limits set by Allah, which He makes clear for people of knowledge.'),
(2, 231, 'When you divorce women and they have &#761;almost&#762; reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or let them go honourably. But do not retain them &#761;only&#762; to harm them &#761;or&#762; to take advantage &#761;of them&#762;. Whoever does that surely wrongs his own soul. Do not take Allah’s revelations lightly. Remember Allah’s favours upon you as well as the Book and wisdom He has sent down for your guidance. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(2, 232, 'When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from re-marrying their ex-husbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more dignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know.'),
(2, 233, '&#761;Divorced&#762; mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years, for those who wish to complete the nursing &#761;of their child&#762;. The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother &#761;during that period&#762;. No one will be charged with more than they can bear. No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The &#761;father’s&#762; heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(2, 234, 'As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them observe a waiting period of four months and ten days. When they have reached the end of this period, then you are not accountable for what they decide for themselves in a reasonable manner. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(2, 235, 'There is no blame on you for subtly showing interest in &#761;divorced or widowed&#762; women or for hiding &#761;the intention&#762; in your hearts. Allah knows that you are considering them &#761;for marriage&#762;. But do not make a secret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them appropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting period expires. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.'),
(2, 236, 'There is no blame if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated or the dowry is settled. But give them a &#761;suitable&#762; compensation—the rich according to his means and the poor according to his. A reasonable compensation is an obligation on the good-doers.'),
(2, 237, 'And if you divorce them before consummating the marriage but after deciding on a dowry, pay half of the dowry, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays in full. Graciousness is closer to righteousness. And do not forget kindness among yourselves. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(2, 238, 'Observe the &#761;five obligatory&#762; prayers—especially the middle prayer—and stand in true devotion to Allah.'),
(2, 239, 'If you are in danger, pray on foot or while riding. But when you are safe, &#761;take time to&#762; remember Allah for teaching you what you did not know.'),
(2, 240, 'Those of you who die leaving widows should bequeath for them a year’s maintenance without forcing them out. But if they choose to leave, you are not accountable for what they reasonably decide for themselves. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(2, 241, 'Reasonable provisions must be made for divorced women—a duty on those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(2, 242, 'This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will understand.'),
(2, 243, 'Have you &#761;O Prophet&#762; not seen those who fled their homes in the thousands for fear of death? Allah said to them, “Die!” then He gave them life. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful.'),
(2, 244, 'Fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 245, 'Who will lend to Allah a good loan which Allah will multiply many times over? It is Allah &#761;alone&#762; who decreases and increases &#761;wealth&#762;. And to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.'),
(2, 246, 'Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, &#761;and&#762; we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we were driven out of our homes and &#761;separated from&#762; our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of the wrongdoers.'),
(2, 247, 'Their prophet told them, “Allah has appointed Saul to be your king.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast riches?” He replied, “Allah has chosen him over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”'),
(2, 248, 'Their prophet further told them, “The sign of Saul’s kingship is that the Ark will come to you—containing reassurance from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a sign for you, if you &#761;truly&#762; believe.”'),
(2, 249, 'When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks &#761;his fill&#762; from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank &#761;their fill&#762; except for a few! When he and the &#761;remaining&#762; faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those &#761;believers&#762; who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is &#761;always&#762; with the steadfast.”'),
(2, 250, 'When they advanced to face Goliath and his warriors, they prayed, “Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, make our steps firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.”'),
(2, 251, 'So they defeated them by Allah’s Will, and David killed Goliath. And Allah blessed David with kingship and wisdom and taught him what He willed. Had Allah not repelled a group of people by &#761;the might of&#762; another, corruption would have dominated the earth, but Allah is Gracious to all.'),
(2, 252, 'These are Allah’s revelations which We recite to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; in truth. And you are truly one of the messengers.'),
(2, 253, 'We have chosen some of those messengers above others. Allah spoke directly to some, and raised some high in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought &#761;among themselves&#762; after receiving the clear proofs. But they differed—some believed while others disbelieved. Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.'),
(2, 254, 'O believers! Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. Those who disbelieve are &#761;truly&#762; the wrongdoers.'),
(2, 255, 'Allah! There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who could possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He &#761;fully&#762; knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills &#761;to reveal&#762;. His Seat encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not tire Him. For He is the Most High, the Greatest.'),
(2, 256, 'Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood. So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 257, 'Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for the disbelievers, their guardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(2, 258, 'Are you &#761;O Prophet&#762; not aware of the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had granted him kingship? &#761;Remember&#762; when Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who has power to give life and cause death.” He argued, “I too have the power to give life and cause death.” Abraham challenged &#761;him&#762;, “Allah causes the sun to rise from the east. So make it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(2, 259, 'Or &#761;are you not aware of&#762; the one who passed by a city which was in ruins. He wondered, “How could Allah bring this back to life after its destruction?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then brought him back to life. Allah asked, “How long have you remained &#761;in this state&#762;?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. &#761;But now&#762; look at &#761;the remains of&#762; your donkey! And &#761;so&#762; We have made you into a sign for humanity. And look at the bones &#761;of the donkey&#762;, how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh!” When this was made clear to him, he declared, “&#761;Now&#762; I know that Allah is Most Capable of everything.”'),
(2, 260, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham said, “My Lord! Show me how you give life to the dead.” Allah responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” Allah said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, &#761;then cut them into pieces,&#762; and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And &#761;so you will&#762; know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(2, 261, 'The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is that of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies &#761;the reward even more&#762; to whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 262, 'Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow their charity with reminders of their generosity or hurtful words—they will get their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 263, 'Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.'),
(2, 264, 'O believers! Do not waste your charity with reminders &#761;of your generosity&#762; or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show off and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Their example is that of a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—leaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of their charity. Allah does not guide &#761;such&#762; disbelieving people.'),
(2, 265, 'And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain, is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(2, 266, 'Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect.'),
(2, 267, 'O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless things for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(2, 268, 'The Devil threatens you with &#761;the prospect of&#762; poverty and bids you to the shameful deed &#761;of stinginess&#762;, while Allah promises you forgiveness and &#761;great&#762; bounties from Him. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.'),
(2, 269, 'Allah grants wisdom to whoever He wills. And whoever is granted wisdom is certainly blessed with a great privilege. But none will be mindful &#761;of this&#762; except people of reason.'),
(2, 270, 'Whatever charities you give or vows you make are surely known to Allah. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.'),
(2, 271, 'To give charity publicly is good, but to give to the poor privately is better for you, and will absolve you of your sins. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(2, 272, 'You are not responsible for people’s guidance &#761;O Prophet&#762;—it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills. Whatever you &#761;believers&#762; spend in charity, it is for your own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged.'),
(2, 273, '&#761;Charity is&#762; for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to move about in the land &#761;for work&#762;. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need &#761;of charity&#762; because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah.'),
(2, 274, 'Those who spend their wealth in charity day and night, secretly and openly—their reward is with their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 275, 'Those who consume interest will stand &#761;on Judgment Day&#762; like those driven to madness by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, “Trade is no different than interest.” But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(2, 276, 'Allah has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And Allah does not like any ungrateful evildoer.'),
(2, 277, 'Indeed, those who believe, do good, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax will receive their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(2, 278, 'O believers! Fear Allah, and give up outstanding interest if you are &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(2, 279, 'If you do not, then beware of a war with Allah and His Messenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principal—neither inflicting nor suffering harm.'),
(2, 280, 'If it is difficult for someone to repay a debt, postpone it until a time of ease. And if you waive it as an act of charity, it will be better for you, if only you knew.'),
(2, 281, 'Be mindful of the Day when you will &#761;all&#762; be returned to Allah, then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged.'),
(2, 282, 'O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing &#761;contracts&#762; for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just &#761;for you&#762; in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded &#761;your limits&#762;. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah &#761;is the One Who&#762; teaches you. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(2, 283, 'If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then &#761;there is no need for a security, but&#762; the debtor should honour this trust &#761;by repaying the debt&#762;—and let them fear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows what you do.'),
(2, 284, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Whether you reveal what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(2, 285, 'The Messenger &#761;firmly&#762; believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They &#761;all&#762; believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. &#761;They proclaim,&#762; “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. &#761;We seek&#762; Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to you &#761;alone&#762; is the final return.”'),
(2, 286, 'Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. &#761;The believers pray,&#762; “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our &#761;only&#762; Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”'),

(3, 4, 'previously, as a guide for people, and &#761;also&#762; revealed the Standard &#761;to distinguish between right and wrong&#762;. Surely those who reject Allah’s revelations will suffer a severe torment. For Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.'),

Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking &#761;to spread&#762; doubt through their &#761;false&#762; interpretations—but none grasps their &#761;full&#762; meaning except Allah.

(3, 13, 'Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies that met in battle—one fighting for the cause of Allah and the other in denial. The believers saw their enemy twice their number. But Allah supports with His victory whoever He wills. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.'),
(3, 14, 'The enjoyment of &#761;worldly&#762; desires—women, children, treasures of gold and silver, fine horses, cattle, and fertile land—has been made appealing to people. These are the pleasures of this worldly life, but with Allah is the finest destination.'),

(3, 19, 'Certainly, Allah’s only Way is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture did not dispute &#761;among themselves&#762; out of mutual envy until knowledge came to them. Whoever denies Allah’s signs, then surely Allah is swift in reckoning.'),
(3, 20, 'So if they argue with you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, say, “I have submitted myself to Allah, and so have my followers.” And ask those who were given the Scripture and the illiterate &#761;people&#762;, “Have you submitted yourselves &#761;to Allah&#762;?” If they submit, they will be &#761;rightly&#762; guided. But if they turn away, then your duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762;. And Allah is All-Seeing of &#761;His&#762; servants.'),

(3, 36, 'When she delivered, she said, “My Lord! I have given birth to a girl,”—and Allah fully knew what she had delivered—“and the male is not like the female. I have named her Mary, and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring from Satan, the accursed.”'),
(3, 37, 'So her Lord accepted her graciously and blessed her with a pleasant upbringing—entrusting her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah visited her in the sanctuary, he found her supplied with provisions. He exclaimed, “O Mary! Where did this come from?” She replied, “It is from Allah. Surely Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit.”'),

(3, 47, 'Mary wondered, “My Lord! How can I have a child when no man has ever touched me?” An angel replied, “So will it be. Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, ‘Be!’ And it is!'),
(3, 48, 'And Allah will teach him writing and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel,'),
(3, 49, 'and &#761;make him&#762; a messenger to the Children of Israel &#761;to proclaim,&#762; ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a &#761;real&#762; bird—by Allah’s Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life—by Allah’s Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses. Surely in this is a sign for you if you &#761;truly&#762; believe.'),
(3, 50, 'And I will confirm the Torah revealed before me and legalize some of what had been forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so be mindful of Allah and obey me.'),
(3, 51, 'Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him &#761;alone&#762;. This is the Straight Path.’”'),
(3, 52, 'When Jesus sensed disbelief from his people, he asked, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah. We believe in Allah, so bear witness that we have submitted.”'),

(3, 54, 'And the disbelievers made a plan &#761;against Jesus&#762;, but Allah also planned—and Allah is the best of planners.'),
(3, 55, '&#761;Remember&#762; when Allah said, “O Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. Then to Me you will &#761;all&#762; return, and I will settle all your disputes.'),
(3, 56, 'As for those who disbelieve, I will subject them to a severe punishment in this life and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.'),
(3, 57, 'And as for those who believe and do good, they will be rewarded in full. And Allah does not like the wrongdoers.”'),
(3, 58, 'We recite &#761;all&#762; this to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; as one of the signs and &#761;as&#762; a wise reminder.'),
(3, 59, 'Indeed, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be!” And he was!'),

(3, 73, 'And only believe those who follow your religion.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Surely, &#761;the only&#762; true guidance is Allah’s guidance.” &#761;They also said,&#762; “Do not believe that someone will receive &#761;revealed&#762; knowledge similar to yours or argue against you before your Lord.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Indeed, all bounty is in the Hands of Allah—He grants it to whoever He wills.

(3, 75, 'There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is because they say, “We are not accountable for &#761;exploiting&#762; the Gentiles.” And &#761;so&#762; they attribute lies to Allah knowingly.'),
(3, 76, 'Absolutely! Those who honour their trusts and shun evil—surely Allah loves those who are mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(3, 77, 'Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting gain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will suffer a painful punishment.'),

(3, 80, 'And he would never ask you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted?'),
(3, 81, '&#761;Remember&#762; when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, &#761;saying,&#762; “Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.”'),

(3, 97, 'In it are clear signs and the standing-place of Abraham. Whoever enters it should be safe. Pilgrimage to this House is an obligation by Allah upon whoever is able among the people. And whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is not in need of &#761;any of His&#762; creation.'),
(3, 98, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O People of the Book! Why do you deny the revelations of Allah, when Allah is a Witness to what you do?”'),
(3, 99, 'Say, “O People of the Book! Why do you turn the believers away from the Way of Allah—striving to make it &#761;appear&#762; crooked, while you are witnesses &#761;to its truth&#762;? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.”'),
(3, 100, 'O believers! If you were to yield to a group of those who were given the Scripture, they would turn you back from belief to disbelief.'),

(3, 106, 'On that Day some faces will be bright while others gloomy. To the gloomy-faced it will be said, “Did you disbelieve after having believed? So taste the punishment for your disbelief.”'),
(3, 107, 'As for the bright-faced, they will be in Allah’s mercy, where they will remain forever.'),
(3, 108, 'These are Allah’s revelations We recite to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; in truth. And Allah desires no injustice to &#761;His&#762; creation.'),

This is &#761;a fair reward&#762; for their disobedience and violations.'),
(3, 113, 'Yet they are not all alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright, who recite Allah’s revelations throughout the night, prostrating &#761;in prayer&#762;.'),

(3, 117, 'The good they do in this worldly life is like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it &#761;completely&#762;. Allah never wronged them, but they wronged themselves.'),
(3, 118, 'O believers! Do not associate closely with those who would not miss a chance to harm you. Their only desire is to see you suffer. Their prejudice has become evident from what they say—and what they hide in their hearts is far worse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if only you understood.'),
(3, 119, 'Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe in all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, “We believe.” But when alone, they bite their fingertips in rage.

(3, 122, '&#761;Remember&#762; when two groups among you &#761;believers&#762; were about to cower, then Allah reassured them. So in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(3, 123, 'Indeed, Allah made you victorious at Badr when you were &#761;vastly&#762; outnumbered. So be mindful of Allah, perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(3, 124, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when you said to the believers, “Is it not enough that your Lord will send down a reinforcement of three thousand angels for your aid?”'),
(3, 125, 'Most certainly, if you &#761;believers&#762; are firm and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels designated &#761;for battle&#762;.'),
(3, 126, 'Allah ordained this &#761;reinforcement&#762; only as good news for you and reassurance for your hearts. And victory comes only from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise—'),
(3, 127, 'to destroy a group of the disbelievers and humble the rest, causing them to withdraw in disappointment.'),
(3, 128, 'You &#761;O Prophet&#762; have no say in the matter. It is up to Allah to turn to them in mercy or punish them, for indeed they are wrongdoers.'),

(3, 140, 'If you have suffered injuries &#761;at U&#7717;ud&#762;, they suffered similarly &#761;at Badr&#762;. We alternate these days &#761;of victory and defeat&#762; among people so that Allah may reveal the &#761;true&#762; believers, choose martyrs from among you—and Allah does not like the wrongdoers—'),
(3, 141, 'and distinguish the &#761;true&#762; believers and destroy the disbelievers.'),
(3, 142, 'Do you think you will enter Paradise without Allah proving which of you &#761;truly&#762; struggled &#761;for His cause&#762; and patiently endured?'),
(3, 143, 'You certainly wished &#761;for the opportunity&#762; for martyrdom before encountering it, now you have seen it with your own eyes.'),
(3, 144, 'Mu&#7717;ammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will reward those who are grateful.'),
(3, 145, 'No soul can ever die without Allah’s Will at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them have it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them. And We will reward those who are grateful.'),
(3, 146, '&#761;Imagine&#762; how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever &#761;losses&#762; they suffered in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere.'),
(3, 147, 'And all they said was, “Our Lord! Forgive our sins and excesses, make our steps firm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”'),
(3, 148, 'So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah loves the good-doers.'),
(3, 149, 'O believers! If you yield to the disbelievers, they will drag you back to disbelief—and you will become losers.'),
(3, 150, 'But no! Allah is your Guardian, and He is the best Helper.'),
(3, 151, 'We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating &#761;false gods&#762; with Allah—a practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay!'),
(3, 152, 'Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you &#761;initially&#762; swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed, after Allah had brought victory within your reach. Some of you were after worldly gain while others desired a heavenly reward. He denied you victory over them as a test, yet He has pardoned you. And Allah is Gracious to the believers.'),
(3, 153, '&#761;Remember&#762; when you were running far away &#761;in panic&#762;—not looking at anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So Allah rewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve over the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(3, 154, 'Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of &#761;pre-Islamic&#762; ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say &#761;to themselves&#762;, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(3, 155, 'Indeed, those &#761;believers&#762; who fled on the day when the two armies met were made to slip by Satan because of their misdeeds. But Allah has pardoned them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.'),
(3, 156, 'O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(3, 157, 'Should you be martyred or die in the cause of Allah, then His forgiveness and mercy are far better than whatever &#761;wealth&#762; those &#761;who stay behind&#762; accumulate.'),
(3, 158, 'Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before Allah.'),
(3, 159, 'It is out of Allah’s mercy that you &#761;O Prophet&#762; have been lenient with them. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly abandoned you. So pardon them, ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, and consult with them in &#761;conducting&#762; matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him.'),
(3, 160, 'If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(3, 161, 'It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war. And whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged.'),
(3, 162, 'Are those who seek Allah’s pleasure like those who deserve Allah’s wrath? Hell is their home. What an evil destination!'),
(3, 163, 'They &#761;each&#762; have varying degrees in the sight of Allah. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.'),
(3, 164, 'Indeed, Allah has done the believers a &#761;great&#762; favour by raising a messenger from among them—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom. For indeed they had previously been clearly astray.'),
(3, 165, 'Why is it when you suffered causalities &#761;at U&#7717;ud&#762;—although you had made your enemy suffer twice as much &#761;at Badr&#762;—you protested, “How could this be?”? Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “It is because of your disobedience.” Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(3, 166, 'So what you suffered on the day the two armies met was by Allah’s Will, so that He might distinguish the &#761;true&#762; believers'),
(3, 167, 'and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or &#761;at least&#762; defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah is All-Knowing of what they hide.'),
(3, 168, 'Those who sat at home, saying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Try not to die if what you say is true!”'),
(3, 169, 'Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for—'),
(3, 170, 'rejoicing in Allah’s bounties and being delighted for those yet to join them. There will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(3, 171, 'They are joyful for receiving Allah’s grace and bounty, and that Allah does not deny the reward of the believers.'),
(3, 172, '&#761;As for&#762; those who responded to the call of Allah and His Messenger after their injury, those of them who did good and were mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; will have a great reward.'),
(3, 173, 'Those who were warned, “Your enemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning only made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “Allah &#761;alone&#762; is sufficient &#761;as an aid&#762; for us and &#761;He&#762; is the best Protector.”'),
(3, 174, 'So they returned with Allah’s favours and grace, suffering no harm. For they sought to please Allah. And surely Allah is &#761;the&#762; Lord of infinite bounty.'),
(3, 175, 'That &#761;warning&#762; was only &#761;from&#762; Satan, trying to prompt you to fear his followers. So do not fear them; fear Me if you are &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(3, 176, '&#761;O Prophet!&#762; Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—surely they will not harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s Will to disallow them a share in the Hereafter, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment.'),
(3, 177, 'Those who trade belief for disbelief will never harm Allah in the least, and they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(3, 178, 'Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment.'),
(3, 179, 'Allah would not leave the believers in the condition you were in, until He distinguished the good from the evil &#761;among you&#762;. Nor would Allah &#761;directly&#762; reveal to you the unseen, but He chooses whoever He wills as a messenger. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you are faithful and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, you will receive a great reward.'),
(3, 180, 'And do not let those who &#761;greedily&#762; withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed &#761;by their necks&#762; on the Day of Judgment with whatever &#761;wealth&#762; they used to withhold. And Allah is the &#761;sole&#762; inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(3, 181, 'Indeed, Allah has heard those &#761;among the Jews&#762; who said, “Allah is poor; we are rich!” We have certainly recorded their slurs and their killing of prophets unjustly. Then We will say, “Taste the torment of burning!'),
(3, 182, 'This is &#761;the reward&#762; for what your hands have done. And Allah is never unjust to &#761;His&#762; servants.”'),
(3, 183, 'Those &#761;are the same people&#762; who say, “Allah has commanded us not to believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire &#761;from the sky&#762;.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Other prophets did in fact come to you before me with clear proofs and &#761;even&#762; what you demanded—why then did you kill them, if what you say is true?”'),
(3, 184, 'If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you who came with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.'),
(3, 185, 'Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Whoever is spared from the Fire and is admitted into Paradise will &#761;indeed&#762; triumph, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.'),
(3, 186, 'You &#761;believers&#762; will surely be tested in your wealth and yourselves, and you will certainly hear many hurtful words from those who were given the Scripture before you and &#761;from&#762; the polytheists. But if you are patient and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;—surely this is a resolve to aspire to.'),
(3, 187, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when Allah took the covenant of those who were given the Scripture to make it known to people and not hide it, yet they cast it behind their backs and traded it for a fleeting gain. What a miserable profit!'),

(3, 189, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),

(3, 191, '&#761;They are&#762; those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth &#761;and pray&#762;, “Our Lord! You have not created &#761;all of&#762; this without purpose. Glory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the Fire.'),

(3, 193, 'Our Lord! We have heard the caller to &#761;true&#762; belief, &#761;proclaiming,&#762; ‘Believe in your Lord &#761;alone&#762;,’ so we believed. Our Lord! Forgive our sins, absolve us of our misdeeds, and allow us &#761;each&#762; to die as one of the virtuous.'),
(3, 194, 'Our Lord! Grant us what You have promised us through Your messengers and do not put us to shame on Judgment Day—for certainly You never fail in Your promise.”'),
(3, 195, 'So their Lord responded to them: “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and &#761;some&#762; were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!”'),

(3, 199, 'Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you &#761;believers&#762; and what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.'),

And be mindful of Allah—in Whose Name you appeal to one another—and &#761;honour&#762; family ties. Surely Allah is ever Watchful over you.'),
(4, 2, 'Give orphans their wealth &#761;when they reach maturity&#762;, and do not exchange your worthless possessions for their valuables, nor cheat them by mixing their wealth with your own. For this would indeed be a great sin.'),
(4, 3, 'If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their &#761;due&#762; rights &#761;if you were to marry them&#762;, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then &#761;content yourselves with&#762; one or those &#761;bondwomen&#762; in your possession. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.'),
(4, 4, 'Give women &#761;you wed&#762; their due dowries graciously. But if they waive some of it willingly, then you may enjoy it freely with a clear conscience.'),
(4, 5, 'Do not entrust the incapable &#761;among your dependants&#762; with your wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you—but feed and clothe them from it, and speak to them kindly.'),
(4, 6, 'Test &#761;the competence of&#762; the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you feel they are capable of sound judgment, return their wealth to them. And do not consume it wastefully and hastily before they grow up &#761;to demand it&#762;. If the guardian is well-off, they should not take compensation; but if the guardian is poor, let them take a reasonable provision. When you give orphans back their property, call in witnesses. And sufficient is Allah as a &#761;vigilant&#762; Reckoner.'),
(4, 7, 'For men there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave, and for women there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave—whether it is little or much. &#761;These are&#762; obligatory shares.');

If you leave only two &#761;or more&#762; females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring. But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third. But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one-sixth—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. &#761;Be fair to&#762; your parents and children, as you do not &#761;fully&#762; know who is more beneficial to you. &#761;This is&#762; an obligation from Allah.

But if you have children, then your wives will receive one-eighth of your estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts. And if a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor children but only a brother or a sister &#761;from their mother’s side&#762;, they will each inherit one-sixth, but if they are more than one, they &#761;all&#762; will share one-third of the estate—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts without harm &#761;to the heirs&#762;. &#761;This is&#762; a commandment from Allah.

So marry them with the permission of their owners, giving them their dowry in fairness, if they are chaste, neither promiscuous nor having secret affairs. If they commit indecency after marriage, they receive half the punishment of free women. This is for those of you who fear falling into sin. But if you are patient, it is better for you.

(4, 92, 'It is not lawful for a believer to kill another except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),

(4, 94, 'O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who you fight. And do not say to those who offer you &#761;greetings of&#762; peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain. Instead, Allah has infinite bounties &#761;in store&#762;. You were initially like them then Allah blessed you &#761;with Islam&#762;. So be sure! Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(4, 95, 'Those who stay at home—except those with valid excuses—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has elevated in rank those who strive with their wealth and their lives above those who stay behind &#761;with valid excuses&#762;. Allah has promised each a fine reward, but those who strive will receive a far better reward than others—'),
(4, 96, 'far superior ranks, forgiveness, and mercy from Him. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 97, 'When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves—scolding them, “What do you think you were doing?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination!'),
(4, 98, 'Except helpless men, women, and children who cannot afford a way out—'),
(4, 99, 'it is right to hope that Allah will pardon them. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.'),
(4, 100, 'Whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find many safe havens and bountiful resources throughout the earth. Those who leave their homes and die while emigrating to Allah and His Messenger—their reward has already been secured with Allah. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 101, 'When you travel through the land, it is permissible for you to shorten the prayer—&#761;especially&#762; if you fear an attack by the disbelievers. Indeed, the disbelievers are your sworn enemies.'),
(4, 102, 'When you &#761;O Prophet&#762; are &#761;campaigning&#762; with them and you lead them in prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they prostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them. Then the group that has not yet prayed will then join you in prayer—and let them be vigilant and armed. The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on you. But there is no blame if you lay aside your weapons when overcome by heavy rain or illness—but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers.'),
(4, 103, 'When the prayers are over, remember Allah—whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down. But when you are secure, establish regular prayers. Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.'),
(4, 104, 'Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are suffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope for. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(4, 105, 'Indeed, We have sent down the Book to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; in truth to judge between people by means of what Allah has shown you. So do not be an advocate for the deceitful.'),
(4, 106, 'And seek Allah’s forgiveness—indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 107, 'Do not advocate for those who wrong themselves. Surely Allah does not like those who are deceitful, sinful.'),
(4, 108, 'They try to hide &#761;their deception&#762; from people, but they can never hide it from Allah—in Whose presence they plot by night what is displeasing to Him. And Allah is Fully Aware of what they do.'),
(4, 109, 'Here you are! You &#761;believers&#762; are advocating for them in this life, but who will &#761;dare to&#762; advocate for them before Allah on the Day of Judgment? Or who will come to their defence?'),
(4, 110, 'Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah’s forgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 111, 'And whoever commits a sin—it is only to their own loss. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(4, 112, 'And whoever commits an evil or sinful deed then blames it on an innocent person, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin.'),
(4, 113, 'Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, a group of them would have sought to deceive you &#761;O Prophet&#762;. Yet they would deceive none but themselves, nor can they harm you in the least. Allah has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and taught you what you never knew. Great &#761;indeed&#762; is Allah’s favour upon you!'),
(4, 114, 'There is no good in most of their secret talks—except those encouraging charity, kindness, or reconciliation between people. And whoever does this seeking Allah’s pleasure, We will grant them a great reward.'),
(4, 115, 'And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them pursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end!'),
(4, 116, 'Surely Allah does not forgive associating &#761;others&#762; with Him &#761;in worship&#762;, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. Indeed, whoever associates &#761;others&#762; with Allah has clearly gone far astray.'),
(4, 117, 'Instead of Allah, they only invoke female gods and they &#761;actually&#762; invoke none but a rebellious Satan—'),
(4, 118, 'cursed by Allah—who said, “I will surely take hold of a certain number of Your servants.'),
(4, 119, 'I will certainly mislead them and delude them with empty hopes. Also, I will order them and they will slit the ears of cattle and alter Allah’s creation.” And whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of Allah has certainly suffered a tremendous loss.'),
(4, 120, 'Satan only makes them &#761;false&#762; promises and deludes them with &#761;empty&#762; hopes. Truly Satan promises them nothing but delusion.'),
(4, 121, 'It is they who will have Hell as their home, and they will find no escape from it!'),
(4, 122, 'And those who believe and do good, We will soon admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah’s promise is &#761;always&#762; true. And whose word is more truthful than Allah’s?'),
(4, 123, '&#761;Divine grace is&#762; neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the Book! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will find no protector or helper besides Allah.'),
(4, 124, 'But those who do good—whether male or female—and have faith will enter Paradise and will never be wronged &#761;even as much as&#762; the speck on a date stone.'),
(4, 125, 'And who is better in faith than those who &#761;fully&#762; submit themselves to Allah, do good, and follow the Way of Abraham, the upright? Allah chose Abraham as a close friend.'),
(4, 126, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is Fully Aware of everything.'),
(4, 127, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; regarding women. Say, “It is Allah Who instructs you regarding them. Instruction has &#761;already&#762; been revealed in the Book concerning the orphan women you deprive of their due rights but still wish to marry, also helpless children, as well as standing up for orphans’ rights. And whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.”'),
(4, 128, 'If a woman fears indifference or neglect from her husband, there is no blame on either of them if they seek &#761;fair&#762; settlement, which is best. Humans are ever inclined to selfishness. But if you are gracious and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(4, 129, 'You will never be able to maintain &#761;emotional&#762; justice between your wives—no matter how keen you are. So do not totally incline towards one leaving the other in suspense. And if you do what is right and are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 130, 'But if they choose to separate, Allah will enrich both of them from His bounties. And Allah is Ever-Bountiful, All-Wise.'),
(4, 131, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Indeed, We have commanded those given the Scripture before you, as well as you, to be mindful of Allah. But if you disobey, then &#761;know that&#762; to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(4, 132, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.'),

(4, 135, 'O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate &#761;from justice&#762;. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then &#761;know that&#762; Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do.'),
(4, 136, 'O believers! Have faith in Allah, His Messenger, the Book He has revealed to His Messenger, and the Scriptures He revealed before. Indeed, whoever denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day has clearly gone far astray.'),
(4, 137, 'Indeed, those who believed then disbelieved, then believed and again disbelieved—&#761;only&#762; increasing in disbelief—Allah will neither forgive them nor guide them to the &#761;Right&#762; Way.'),
(4, 138, 'Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites,'),
(4, 139, 'who choose disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek honour and power through that company? Surely all honour and power belongs to Allah.'),
(4, 140, 'He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them. Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.'),
(4, 141, '&#761;The hypocrites are&#762; those who wait to see what happens to you. So if Allah grants you victory, they say &#761;to you&#762;, “Were we not on your side?” But if the disbelievers have a share &#761;of victory&#762;, they say &#761;to them&#762;, “Did we not have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?” Allah will judge between &#761;all of&#762; you on the Day of Judgment. And Allah will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers.'),
(4, 142, 'Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He outwits them. When they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by people—hardly remembering Allah at all.'),
(4, 143, 'Torn between belief and disbelief—belonging neither to these &#761;believers&#762; nor those &#761;disbelievers&#762;. And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way.'),
(4, 144, 'O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give Allah solid proof against yourselves?'),
(4, 145, 'Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire—and you will never find for them any helper—'),
(4, 146, 'except those who repent, mend their ways, hold fast to Allah, and are sincere in their devotion to Allah; they will be with the believers. And Allah will grant the believers a great reward.'),
(4, 147, 'Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and faithful? Allah is ever Appreciative, All-Knowing.'),
(4, 148, 'Allah does not like negative thoughts to be voiced—except by those who have been wronged. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(4, 149, 'Whether you reveal or conceal a good or pardon an evil—surely Allah is Ever-Pardoning, Most Capable.'),
(4, 150, 'Surely those who deny Allah and His messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers, saying, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” desiring to forge a compromise,'),
(4, 151, 'they are indeed the true disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.'),
(4, 152, 'As for those who believe in Allah and His messengers—accepting all; rejecting none—He will surely give them their rewards. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(4, 153, 'The People of the Book demand that you &#761;O Prophet&#762; bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven. They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that &#761;after their repentance&#762; and gave Moses compelling proof.'),
(4, 154, 'We raised the Mount over them &#761;as a warning&#762; for &#761;breaking&#762; their covenant and said, “Enter the gate &#761;of Jerusalem&#762; with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant.'),
(4, 155, '&#761;They were condemned&#762; for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few—'),
(4, 156, 'and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary,'),
(4, 157, 'and for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so. Even those who argue for this &#761;crucifixion&#762; are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him.'),
(4, 158, 'Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(4, 159, 'Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a witness against them.'),
(4, 160, 'We forbade the Jews certain foods that had been lawful to them for their wrongdoing, and for hindering many from the Way of Allah,'),
(4, 161, 'taking interest despite its prohibition, and consuming people’s wealth unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.'),
(4, 162, 'But those of them well-grounded in knowledge, the faithful &#761;who&#762; believe in what has been revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; and what was revealed before you—&#761;especially&#762; those who establish prayer—and those who pay alms-tax and believe in Allah and the Last Day, to these &#761;people&#762; We will grant a great reward.'),
(4, 163, 'Indeed, We have sent revelation to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, &#761;as well as&#762; Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And to David We gave the Psalms.'),
(4, 164, 'There are messengers whose stories We have told you already and others We have not. And to Moses Allah spoke directly.'),
(4, 165, '&#761;All were&#762; messengers delivering good news and warnings so humanity should have no excuse before Allah after &#761;the coming of&#762; the messengers. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(4, 166, 'Yet &#761;if you are denied, O Prophet,&#762; Allah bears witness to what He has sent down to you—He has sent it with His knowledge. The angels too bear witness. And Allah &#761;alone&#762; is sufficient as a Witness.'),
(4, 167, 'Those who disbelieve and hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah have certainly strayed far away.'),
(4, 168, 'Those who disbelieve and wrong themselves—surely Allah will neither forgive them nor guide them to any path'),
(4, 169, 'except that of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever. And that is easy for Allah.'),
(4, 170, 'O humanity! The Messenger has certainly come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe for your own good. But if you disbelieve, then &#761;know that&#762; to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(4, 171, 'O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit &#761;created by a command&#762; from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for your own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.'),
(4, 172, 'The Messiah would never be too proud to be a servant of Allah, nor would the angels nearest to Allah. Those who are too proud and arrogant to worship Him will be brought before Him all together.'),
(4, 173, 'As for those who believe and do good, He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. But those who are too proud and arrogant, He will subject them to a painful punishment. And besides Allah they will find no protector or helper.'),
(4, 174, 'O humanity! There has come to you conclusive evidence from your Lord. And We have sent down to you a brilliant light.'),
(4, 175, 'As for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into His mercy and grace and guide them to Himself through the Straight Path.'),
(4, 176, 'They ask you &#761;for a ruling, O Prophet&#762;. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling regarding those who die without children or parents.” If a man dies childless and leaves behind a sister, she will inherit one-half of his estate, whereas her brother will inherit all of her estate if she dies childless. If this person leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the estate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share will be equal to that of two females. Allah makes &#761;this&#762; clear to you so you do not go astray. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(5, 1, 'O believers! Honour your obligations. All grazing livestock has been made lawful to you—except what is hereby announced to you and hunting while on pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah commands what He wills.'),
(5, 2, 'O believers! Do not violate Allah’s rituals &#761;of pilgrimage&#762;, the sacred months, the sacrificial animals, the &#761;offerings decorated with&#762; garlands, nor those &#761;pilgrims&#762; on their way to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s bounty and pleasure. When pilgrimage has ended, you are allowed to hunt. Do not let the hatred of a people who once barred you from the Sacred Mosque provoke you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.'),
(5, 3, 'Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and swine; what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah; what is killed by strangling, beating, a fall, or by being gored to death; what is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it; and what is sacrificed on altars. You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions. This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of &#761;undermining&#762; your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me! Today I have perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and chosen Islam as your way. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger—not intending to sin—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(5, 4, 'They ask you, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; what is permissible for them &#761;to eat&#762;. Say, “What is good and lawful. Also what is caught by your hunting animals and birds of prey which you have trained as instructed by Allah. So eat what they catch for you, but mention the Name of Allah over it &#761;first&#762;.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.'),
(5, 5, 'Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And &#761;permissible for you in marriage&#762; are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void &#761;in this life&#762; and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers.'),
(5, 6, 'O believers! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of &#761;full&#762; impurity, then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands. It is not Allah’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(5, 7, 'Remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant He made with you when you said, “We hear and obey.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(5, 8, 'O believers! Stand firm for Allah and bear true testimony. Do not let the hatred of a people lead you to injustice. Be just! That is closer to righteousness. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(5, 9, 'Allah has promised those who believe and do good &#761;His&#762; forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(5, 10, 'As for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the residents of the Hellfire.'),
(5, 11, 'O believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you: when a people sought to harm you, but He held their hands back from you. Be mindful of Allah. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(5, 12, 'Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders from among them and &#761;then&#762; said, “I am truly with you. If you establish prayer, pay alms-tax, believe in My messengers, support them, and lend to Allah a good loan, I will certainly forgive your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow. And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”'),
(5, 13, 'But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You &#761;O Prophet&#762; will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.'),
(5, 14, 'And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We took their covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. So We let hostility and enmity arise between them until the Day of Judgment, and soon Allah will inform them of all they have done.'),
(5, 15, 'O People of the Book! Now Our Messenger has come to you, revealing much of what you have hidden of the Scriptures and disregarding much. There certainly has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book'),
(5, 16, 'through which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the ways of peace, brings them out of darkness and into light by His Will, and guides them to the Straight Path.'),
(5, 17, 'Indeed, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have fallen into disbelief. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Who has the power to prevent Allah if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and everyone in the world all together?” To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(5, 18, 'The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.”'),
(5, 19, 'O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making things clear to you after an interval between the messengers so you do not say, “There has never come to us a deliverer of good news or a warner.” Now there has come to you a deliverer of good news and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(5, 20, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Remember Allah’s favours upon you when He raised prophets from among you, made you sovereign, and gave you what He had never given anyone in the world.'),
(5, 21, 'O my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you &#761;to enter&#762;. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.”'),
(5, 22, 'They replied, “O Moses! There is an enormously powerful people there, so we will never &#761;be able to&#762; enter it until they leave. If they do, then we will enter!”'),
(5, 23, 'Two God-fearing men—who had been blessed by Allah—said, “Surprise them through the gate. If you do, you will certainly prevail. Put your trust in Allah if you are &#761;truly&#762; believers.”'),
(5, 24, '&#761;Yet&#762; they said, “O Moses! &#761;Still&#762; we will never enter as long as they remain there. So go—both you and your Lord—and fight; we are staying right here!”'),
(5, 25, 'Moses pleaded, “My Lord! I have no control over anyone except myself and my brother. So set us apart from the rebellious people.”'),
(5, 26, 'Allah replied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which they will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious people.”'),
(5, 27, 'Relate to them in truth &#761;O Prophet&#762; the story of Adam’s two sons—how each offered a sacrifice: Abel’s offering was accepted while Cain’s was not. So Cain threatened, “I will kill you!” His brother replied, “Allah only accepts &#761;the offering&#762; of the sincerely devout.'),
(5, 28, 'If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you, because I fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.'),
(5, 29, 'I want to let you bear your sin against me along with your other sins, then you will be one of those destined to the Fire. And that is the reward of the wrongdoers.”'),
(5, 30, 'Yet Cain convinced himself to kill his brother, so he killed him—becoming a loser.'),
(5, 31, 'Then Allah sent a crow digging &#761;a grave&#762; in the ground &#761;for a dead crow&#762;, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I &#761;even&#762; failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.'),
(5, 32, 'That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. &#761;Although&#762; Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.'),
(5, 33, 'Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This &#761;penalty&#762; is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.'),
(5, 34, 'As for those who repent before you seize them, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(5, 35, 'O believers! Be mindful of Allah and seek what brings you closer to Him and struggle in His Way, so you may be successful.'),
(5, 36, 'As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over &#761;and offer it all&#762; to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. And they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(5, 37, 'They will be desperate to get out of the Fire but they will never be able to. And they will suffer an everlasting punishment.'),
(5, 38, 'As for male and female thieves, cut off their hands for what they have done—a deterrent from Allah. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(5, 39, 'But whoever repents after their wrongdoing and mends their ways, Allah will surely turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(5, 40, 'Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah &#761;alone&#762;? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(5, 41, 'O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get &#761;from Mu&#7717;ammad&#762;, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.'),
(5, 42, 'They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain. So if they come to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those who are just.'),
(5, 43, 'But why do they come to you for judgment when they &#761;already&#762; have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(5, 44, 'Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are &#761;truly&#762; the disbelievers.'),
(5, 45, 'We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are &#761;truly&#762; the wrongdoers.'),
(5, 46, 'Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.'),
(5, 47, 'So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are &#761;truly&#762; the rebellious.'),
(5, 48, 'We have revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given &#761;each of&#762; you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you &#761;of the truth&#762; regarding your differences.'),
(5, 49, 'And judge between them &#761;O Prophet&#762; by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, so they do not lure you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away &#761;from Allah’s judgment&#762;, then know that it is Allah’s Will to repay them for some of their sins, and that many people are indeed rebellious.'),
(5, 50, 'Is it the judgment of &#761;pre-Islamic&#762; ignorance they seek? Who could be a better judge than Allah for people of sure faith?'),
(5, 51, 'O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(5, 52, 'You see those with sickness in their hearts racing for their guardianship, saying &#761;in justification&#762;, “We fear a turn of fortune will strike us.” But perhaps Allah will bring about &#761;your&#762; victory or another favour by His command, and they will regret what they have hidden in their hearts.'),
(5, 53, '&#761;Only then,&#762; the believers will ask &#761;one another&#762;, “Are these the ones who swore solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their deeds have been in vain, so they have become losers.'),
(5, 54, 'O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is Ever-Bountiful, All-Knowing.'),
(5, 55, 'Your only guardians are Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers—who establish prayer and pay alms-tax with humility.'),
(5, 56, 'Whoever allies themselves with Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is certainly Allah’s party that will prevail.'),
(5, 57, 'O believers! Do not seek the guardianship of those given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers who have made your faith a mockery and amusement. And be mindful of Allah if you are &#761;truly&#762; believers.'),
(5, 58, 'When you call to prayer, they mock it in amusement. This is because they are a people without understanding.'),
(5, 59, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O People of the Book! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before—while most of you are rebellious?”'),
(5, 60, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from Allah &#761;than the rebellious&#762;? It is those who earned Allah’s condemnation and displeasure—some being reduced to apes and pigs and worshippers of false gods. These are far worse in rank and farther astray from the Right Way.”'),
(5, 61, 'When they come to you &#761;believers&#762; they say, “We believe.” But they are committed to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And Allah knows what they hide.'),
(5, 62, 'You see many of them racing towards sin, transgression, and consumption of forbidden gain. Evil indeed are their actions!'),
(5, 63, 'Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and consuming what is unlawful? Evil indeed is their inaction!'),
(5, 64, '&#761;Some among&#762; the Jews said, “Allah is tight-fisted.” May their fists be tied and they be condemned for what they said. Rather, He is open-handed, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred until the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah puts it out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And Allah does not like corruptors.'),
(5, 65, 'Had the People of the Book only been faithful and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, We would have certainly absolved them of their sins and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.'),
(5, 66, 'And had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have been overwhelmed with provisions from above and below. Some among them are upright, yet many do nothing but evil.'),
(5, 67, 'O Messenger! Convey everything revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, then you have not delivered His message. Allah will &#761;certainly&#762; protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the people who disbelieve.'),
(5, 68, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.'),
(5, 69, 'Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians and Christians—whoever &#761;truly&#762; believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(5, 70, 'Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not desire, they denied some and killed others.'),
(5, 71, 'They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness &#761;after their repentance&#762;, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.'),
(5, 72, 'Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah &#761;himself&#762; said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah &#761;in worship&#762; will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.'),
(5, 73, 'Those who say, “Allah is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.'),
(5, 74, 'Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(5, 75, 'The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. &#761;Many&#762; messengers had &#761;come and&#762; gone before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both ate food. See how We make the signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;!'),
(5, 76, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “How can you worship besides Allah those who can neither harm nor benefit you? And Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.”'),
(5, 77, 'Say, “O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your faith beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of those who went astray before &#761;you&#762;. They misled many and strayed from the Right Way.”'),
(5, 78, 'The disbelievers among the Children of Israel were condemned in the revelations of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That was for their disobedience and violations.'),
(5, 79, 'They did not forbid one another from doing evil. Evil indeed was what they did!'),
(5, 80, 'You see many of them taking the disbelievers as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have earned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment.'),
(5, 81, 'Had they believed in Allah, the Prophet, and what has been revealed to him, they would have never taken those &#761;pagans&#762; as allies. But most of them are rebellious.'),
(5, 82, 'You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant.'),
(5, 83, 'When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses.'),
(5, 84, 'Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous.”'),
(5, 85, 'So Allah will reward them for what they said with Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. And that is the reward of the good-doers.'),
(5, 86, 'As for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.'),
(5, 87, 'O believers! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.'),
(5, 88, 'Eat of the good, lawful things provided to you by Allah. And be mindful of Allah in Whom you believe.'),
(5, 89, 'Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(5, 90, 'O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful.'),
(5, 91, 'Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain?'),
(5, 92, 'Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly.'),
(5, 93, 'There is no blame on those who believe and do good for what they had consumed before &#761;the prohibition&#762;, as long as they fear Allah, have faith, and do what is good; then they believe and act virtuously, then become fully mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; and do righteous deeds. For Allah loves the good-doers.'),
(5, 94, 'O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever transgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(5, 95, 'O believers! Do not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally must compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men among you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah has forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by Allah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.'),
(5, 96, 'It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage. Be mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered.'),
(5, 97, 'Allah has made the Ka’bah—the Sacred House—a sanctuary of well-being for all people, along with the sacred months, the sacrificial animals, and the &#761;offerings decorated with&#762; garlands. All this so you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and that He has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of everything.'),
(5, 98, 'Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(5, 99, 'The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762;. And Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows what you reveal and what you conceal.'),
(5, 100, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be dazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O people of reason, so you may be successful.”'),
(5, 101, 'O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done &#761;in the past&#762;. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.'),
(5, 102, 'Some people before you asked such questions then denied their answers.'),
(5, 103, 'Allah has never ordained the &#761;so-called&#762; ba&#7717;îrah, sâ\'ibah, wa&#7779;îlah, and &#7717;âm camels. But the disbelievers just fabricate lies about Allah, and most of them lack understanding.'),
(5, 104, 'When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” they reply, “What we found our forefathers practicing is good enough for us.” &#761;Would they still do so,&#762; even if their forefathers had absolutely no knowledge or guidance?'),
(5, 105, 'O believers! You are accountable only for yourselves. It will not harm you if someone chooses to deviate—as long as you are &#761;rightly&#762; guided. To Allah you will all return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.'),
(5, 106, 'O believers! When death approaches any of you, call upon two just Muslim men to witness as you make a bequest; otherwise, two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while on a journey. If you doubt &#761;their testimony&#762;, keep them after prayer and let them testify under oath &#761;saying&#762;, “By Allah! We would never sell our testimony for any price, even in favour of a close relative, nor withhold the testimony of Allah. Otherwise, we would surely be sinful.”'),
(5, 107, 'If they are found guilty &#761;of false testimony&#762;, let the deceased’s two closest heirs affected by the bequest replace the witnesses and testify under oath &#761;saying&#762;, “By Allah! Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed. Otherwise, we would surely be wrongdoers.”'),
(5, 108, 'In this way it is more likely that witnesses will give true testimony or else fear that their oaths could be refuted by those of the heirs. Be mindful of Allah and obey. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.'),
(5, 109, '&#761;Consider&#762; the Day Allah will gather the messengers and say, “What response did you receive?” They will reply, “We have no knowledge &#761;compared to You&#762;! You &#761;alone&#762; are indeed the Knower of all unseen.”'),
(5, 110, 'And &#761;on Judgment Day&#762; Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour upon you and your mother: how I supported you with the holy spirit so you spoke to people in &#761;your&#762; infancy and adulthood. How I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel. How you moulded a bird from clay—by My Will—and breathed into it and it became a &#761;real&#762; bird—by My Will. How you healed the blind and the lepers—by My Will. How you brought the dead to life—by My Will. How I prevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with clear proofs and the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but pure magic.”'),
(5, 111, 'And how I inspired the disciples, “Believe in Me and My messenger!” They declared, “We believe and bear witness that we fully submit &#761;to Allah&#762;.”'),
(5, 112, '&#761;Remember&#762; when the disciples asked, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Will your Lord be willing to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?” Jesus answered, “Fear Allah if you are &#761;truly&#762; believers.”'),
(5, 113, 'They said, “We &#761;only&#762; wish to eat from it to reassure our hearts, to verify you are indeed truthful to us, and to become its witnesses.”'),
(5, 114, 'Jesus, son of Mary, prayed, “O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food as a feast for us—the first and last of us—and as a sign from You. Provide for us! You are indeed the Best Provider.”'),
(5, 115, 'Allah answered, “I am sending it down to you. But whoever among you denies afterwards will be subjected to a torment I have never inflicted on anyone of My creation.”'),
(5, 116, 'And &#761;on Judgment Day&#762; Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is &#761;hidden&#762; within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You &#761;alone&#762; are the Knower of all unseen.'),
(5, 117, 'I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: “Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!” And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me, You were the Witness over them—and You are a Witness over all things.'),
(5, 118, 'If You punish them, they belong to You after all. But if You forgive them, You are surely the Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(5, 119, 'Allah will declare, “This is the Day when &#761;only&#762; the faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph.”'),

(6, 41, 'No! He is the only One you would call. And if He willed, He could remove the affliction that made you invoke Him. Only then will you forget whatever you associate with Him &#761;in worship&#762;.”'),
(6, 42, 'Indeed, We have sent messengers before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to other people who We put through suffering and adversity &#761;for their denial&#762;, so perhaps they would be humbled.'),
(6, 43, 'Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them.'),
(6, 44, 'When they became oblivious to warnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they became prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then they instantly fell into despair!'),
(6, 45, 'So the wrongdoers were utterly uprooted. And all praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds.'),
(6, 46, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Imagine if Allah were to take away your hearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than Allah could restore it?” See &#761;O Prophet&#762; how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away.'),
(6, 47, 'Ask, “Imagine if Allah’s punishment were to overwhelm you with or without warning—who would be destroyed other than the wrongdoers?”'),
(6, 48, 'We have sent messengers only as deliverers of good news and as warners. Whoever believes and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(6, 49, 'But those who deny Our signs will be afflicted with punishment for their rebelliousness.'),
(6, 50, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I do not say to you that I possess Allah’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Are those blind &#761;to the truth&#762; equal to those who can see? Will you not then reflect?”'),
(6, 51, 'Warn with this &#761;Quran&#762; those who are awed by the prospect of being gathered before their Lord—when they will have no protector or intercessor besides Him—so perhaps they will be mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(6, 52, '&#761;O Prophet!&#762; Do not dismiss those &#761;poor believers&#762; who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do not dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers.'),
(6, 53, 'In this way We have tested some by means of others, so those &#761;disbelievers&#762; may say, “Has Allah favoured these &#761;poor believers&#762; out of all of us?” Does Allah not best recognize the grateful?'),
(6, 54, 'When the believers in Our revelations come to you, say, “Peace be upon you! Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be Merciful. Whoever among you commits evil ignorantly &#761;or recklessly&#762; then repents afterwards and mends their ways, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),
(6, 55, 'This is how We make Our signs clear, so the way of the wicked may become distinct.'),
(6, 56, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides Allah.” Say, “I will not follow your desires, for I then would certainly be astray and not one of those &#761;rightly&#762; guided.”'),
(6, 57, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Indeed, I stand on a clear proof from my Lord—yet you have denied it. That &#761;torment&#762; you seek to hasten is not within my power. It is only Allah Who decides &#761;its time&#762;. He declares the truth. And He is the Best of Judges.”'),
(6, 58, 'Say &#761;also&#762;, “If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter between us would have already been settled. But Allah knows the wrongdoers best.”'),
(6, 59, 'With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him. And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green or dry—but is &#761;written&#762; in a perfect Record.'),
(6, 60, 'He is the One Who calls back your souls by night and knows what you do by day, then revives you daily to complete your appointed term. To Him is your &#761;ultimate&#762; return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.'),
(6, 61, 'He reigns supreme over all of His creation, and sends recording-angels, watching over you. When death comes to any of you, Our angels take their soul, never neglecting this duty.'),
(6, 62, 'Then they are &#761;all&#762; returned to Allah—their True Master. Judgment is His &#761;alone&#762;. And He is the Swiftest Reckoner.'),
(6, 63, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Who rescues you from the darkest times on land and at sea? He &#761;alone&#762; you call upon with humility, openly and secretly: “If You rescue us from this, we will be ever grateful.”'),
(6, 64, 'Say, “&#761;Only&#762; Allah rescues you from this and any other distress, yet you associate others with Him &#761;in worship&#762;.”'),
(6, 65, 'Say, “He &#761;alone&#762; has the power to unleash upon you a torment from above or below you or split you into &#761;conflicting&#762; factions and make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the signs, so perhaps they will comprehend.'),
(6, 66, 'Still your people &#761;O Prophet&#762; have rejected this &#761;Quran&#762;, although it is the truth. Say, “I am not a keeper over you.”'),
(6, 67, 'Every &#761;destined&#762; matter has a &#761;set&#762; time to transpire. And you will soon come to know.'),
(6, 68, 'And when you come across those who ridicule Our revelations, do not sit with them unless they engage in a different topic. Should Satan make you forget, then once you remember, do not &#761;continue to&#762; sit with the wrongdoing people.'),
(6, 69, 'Those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; will not be accountable for those &#761;who ridicule it&#762; whatsoever—their duty is to advise, so perhaps the ridiculers will abstain.'),
(6, 70, 'And leave those who take this faith &#761;of Islam&#762; as mere play and amusement and are deluded by &#761;their&#762; worldly life. Yet remind them by this &#761;Quran&#762;, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every &#761;possible&#762; ransom, none will be accepted from them. Those are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have a boiling drink and painful punishment for their disbelief.'),
(6, 71, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Should we invoke, other than Allah, those &#761;idols&#762; which cannot benefit or harm us, and turn back to disbelief after Allah has guided us? &#761;If we do so, we will be&#762; like those disoriented by devils in the wilderness, while their companions call them to guidance, &#761;saying&#762;, ‘Come to us!’ Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Allah’s guidance is the &#761;only&#762; true guidance. And we are commanded to submit to the Lord of all worlds,'),
(6, 72, 'establish prayer, and be mindful of Him. To Him you will all be gathered together.'),
(6, 73, 'He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day &#761;of Judgment&#762; He will say, ‘Be!’ And there will be! His command is truth. All authority is His &#761;alone&#762; on the Day the Trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of all—seen or unseen. And He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.”'),
(6, 74, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham said to his father, &#514;zar, “Do you take idols as gods? It is clear to me that you and your people are entirely misguided.”'),
(6, 75, 'We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so he would be sure in faith.'),
(6, 76, 'When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, “This is my Lord!” But when it set, he said, “I do not love things that set.”'),
(6, 77, 'Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This one is my Lord!” But when it disappeared, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will certainly be one of the misguided people.”'),
(6, 78, 'Then when he saw the sun shining, he said, “This must be my Lord—it is the greatest!” But again when it set, he declared, “O my people! I totally reject whatever you associate &#761;with Allah in worship&#762;.'),
(6, 79, 'I have turned my face towards the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth—being upright—and I am not one of the polytheists.”'),
(6, 80, 'And his people argued with him. He responded, “Are you arguing with me about Allah, while He has guided me? I am not afraid of whatever &#761;idols&#762; you associate with Him—&#761;none can harm me,&#762; unless my Lord so wills. My Lord encompasses everything in &#761;His&#762; knowledge. Will you not be mindful?'),
(6, 81, 'And how should I fear your associate-gods, while you have no fear in associating &#761;others&#762; with Allah—a practice He has never authorized? Which side has more right to security? &#761;Tell me&#762; if you really know!”'),
(6, 82, 'It is &#761;only&#762; those who are faithful and do not tarnish their faith with falsehood who are guaranteed security and are &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(6, 83, 'This was the argument We gave Abraham against his people. We elevate in rank whoever We please. Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.'),
(6, 84, 'And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We previously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. This is how We reward the good-doers.'),
(6, 85, 'Likewise, &#761;We guided&#762; Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of the righteous.'),
(6, 86, '&#761;We also guided&#762; Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, favouring each over other people &#761;of their time&#762;.'),
(6, 87, 'And &#761;We favoured&#762; some of their forefathers, their descendants, and their brothers. We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path.'),
(6, 88, 'This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whoever He wills of His servants. Had they associated others with Him &#761;in worship&#762;, their &#761;good&#762; deeds would have been wasted.'),
(6, 89, 'Those were the ones to whom We gave the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood. But if these &#761;pagans&#762; disbelieve in this &#761;message&#762;, then We have already entrusted it to a people who will never disbelieve in it.'),
(6, 90, 'These &#761;prophets&#762; were &#761;rightly&#762; guided by Allah, so follow their guidance. Say, “I ask no reward of you for this &#761;Quran&#762;—it is a reminder to the whole world.”'),
(6, 91, 'And they have not shown Allah His proper reverence when they said, “Allah has revealed nothing to any human being.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Who then revealed the Book brought forth by Moses as a light and guidance for people, which you split into separate sheets—revealing some and hiding much? You have been taught &#761;through this Quran&#762; what neither you nor your forefathers knew.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Allah &#761;revealed it&#762;!” Then leave them to amuse themselves with falsehood.'),
(6, 92, 'This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came before it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities and everyone around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter &#761;truly&#762; believe in it and guard their prayers.'),
(6, 93, 'Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”? If you &#761;O Prophet&#762; could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands &#761;saying&#762;, “Give up your souls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling lies about Allah and for being arrogant towards His revelations!”'),
(6, 94, '&#761;Today&#762; you have come back to Us all alone as We created you the first time—leaving behind everything We have provided you with. We do not see your intercessors with you—those you claimed were Allah’s partners &#761;in worship&#762;. All your ties have been broken and all your claims have let you down.”'),
(6, 95, 'Indeed, Allah is the One Who causes seeds and fruit stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is Allah! How can you then be deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;?'),
(6, 96, 'He causes the dawn to break, and has made the night for rest and &#761;made&#762; the sun and the moon &#761;to travel&#762; with precision. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.'),
(6, 97, 'And He is the One Who has made the stars as your guide through the darkness of land and sea. We have already made the signs clear for people who know.'),
(6, 98, 'And He is the One Who originated you all from a single soul, then assigned you a place to live and another to &#761;be laid to&#762; rest. We have already made the signs clear for people who comprehend.'),
(6, 99, 'And He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky—causing all kinds of plants to grow—producing green stalks from which We bring forth clustered grain. And from palm trees come clusters of dates hanging within reach. &#761;There are&#762; also gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates, similar &#761;in shape&#762; but dissimilar &#761;in taste&#762;. Look at their fruit as it yields and ripens! Indeed, in these are signs for people who believe.'),
(6, 100, 'Yet they associate the jinn with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters out of ignorance. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they claim!'),
(6, 101, '&#761;He is&#762; the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have children when He has no mate? He created all things and has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of everything.'),
(6, 102, 'That is Allah—your Lord! There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. &#761;He is&#762; the Creator of all things, so worship Him &#761;alone&#762;. And He is the Maintainer of everything.'),
(6, 103, 'No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.'),
(6, 104, 'Indeed, there have come to you insights from your Lord. So whoever chooses to see, it is for their own good. But whoever chooses to be blind, it is to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.'),
(6, 105, 'And so We vary our signs to the extent that they will say, “You have studied &#761;previous scriptures&#762;,” and We make this &#761;Quran&#762; clear for people who know.'),
(6, 106, '&#761;O Prophet!&#762; Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord—there is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him—and turn away from the polytheists.'),
(6, 107, 'Had Allah willed, they would not have been polytheists. We have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer.'),
(6, 108, '&#761;O believers!&#762; Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made each people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.'),
(6, 109, 'They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Signs are only with Allah.” What will make you &#761;believers&#762; realize that even if a sign were to come to them, they still would not believe?'),
(6, 110, 'We turn their hearts and eyes away &#761;from the truth&#762; as they refused to believe at first, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.'),
(6, 111, 'Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign &#761;they demanded&#762;, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant &#761;of this&#762;.'),
(6, 112, 'And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans and jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had it been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their deceit,'),
(6, 113, 'so that the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter may be receptive to it, be pleased with it, and be persistent in their evil pursuits.'),
(6, 114, '&#761;Say, O Prophet,&#762; “Should I seek a judge other than Allah while He is the One Who has revealed for you the Book &#761;with the truth&#762; perfectly explained?” Those who were given the Scripture know that it has been revealed &#761;to you&#762; from your Lord in truth. So do not be one of those who doubt.'),
(6, 115, 'The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearing, All- Knowing.'),
(6, 116, '&#761;O Prophet!&#762; If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would lead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie.'),
(6, 117, 'Indeed, your Lord knows best who has strayed from His Way and who is &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(6, 118, 'So eat only of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name if you truly believe in His revelations.'),
(6, 119, 'Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden to you—except when compelled by necessity? Many &#761;deviants&#762; certainly mislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows the transgressors best.'),
(6, 120, 'Shun all sin—open and secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be punished for what they earn.'),
(6, 121, 'Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be &#761;an act of&#762; disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their &#761;human&#762; associates to argue with you. If you were to obey them, then you &#761;too&#762; would be polytheists.'),
(6, 122, 'Can those who had been dead, to whom We gave life and a light with which they can walk among people, be compared to those in complete darkness from which they can never emerge? That is how the misdeeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.'),
(6, 123, 'And so We have placed in every society the most wicked to conspire in it. Yet they plot only against themselves, but they fail to perceive it.'),
(6, 124, 'Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.'),
(6, 125, 'Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam. But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve.'),
(6, 126, 'That is your Lord’s Path—perfectly straight. We have already made the signs clear to those who are mindful.'),
(6, 127, 'They will have the Home of Peace with their Lord, Who will be their Guardian because of what they used to do.'),
(6, 128, '&#761;Consider&#762; the Day He will gather them &#761;all&#762; together and say, “O assembly of jinn! You misled humans in great numbers.” And their human associates will say, “Our Lord! We benefited from each other’s company, but now we have reached the term which You appointed for us.” &#761;Then&#762; He will say, “The Fire is your home, yours to stay in forever, except whoever Allah wills to spare.” Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.'),
(6, 129, 'This is how We make the wrongdoers &#761;destructive&#762; allies of one another because of their misdeeds.'),
(6, 130, '&#761;Allah will ask,&#762; “O assembly of jinn and humans! Did messengers not come from among you, proclaiming My revelations and warning you of the coming of this Day of yours?” They will say, “We confess against ourselves!” For they have been deluded by &#761;their&#762; worldly life. And they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.'),
(6, 131, 'This &#761;sending of the messengers&#762; is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware &#761;of the truth&#762;.'),
(6, 132, 'They will each be assigned ranks according to their deeds. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.'),
(6, 133, 'Your Lord is the Self-Sufficient, Full of Mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and replace you with whoever He wills, just as He produced you from the offspring of other people.'),
(6, 134, 'Indeed, what you have been promised will certainly come to pass. And you will have no escape.'),
(6, 135, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I &#761;too&#762; will persist in mine. You will soon know who will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”'),
(6, 136, 'The pagans set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle He created, saying, “This &#761;portion&#762; is for Allah,” so they claim, “and this &#761;one&#762; for our associate-gods.” Yet the portion of their associate-gods is not shared with Allah while Allah’s portion is shared with their associate-gods. What unfair judgment!'),
(6, 137, 'Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them to kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as confusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood.'),
(6, 138, 'They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them except those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted from labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely attributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies.'),
(6, 139, 'They &#761;also&#762; say, “The offspring of this cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our females; but if it is stillborn, they may all share it.” He will repay them for their falsehood. Surely He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.'),
(6, 140, 'Lost indeed are those who have murdered their own children foolishly out of ignorance and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them—falsely attributing lies to Allah. They have certainly strayed and are not &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(6, 141, 'He is the One Who produces gardens—both cultivated and wild—and palm trees, crops of different flavours, olives, and pomegranates—similar &#761;in shape&#762;, but dissimilar &#761;in taste&#762;. Eat from the fruit they bear and pay the dues at harvest, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful.'),
(6, 142, 'Some cattle are fit for labour, others are too small. Eat of what Allah has provided for you and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. Certainly, he is your sworn enemy.'),
(6, 143, '&#761;Allah has created&#762; four pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats—ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Has He forbidden &#761;to you&#762; the two males or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females? Tell me with knowledge, if what you say is true.”—'),
(6, 144, 'and a pair of camels and a pair of oxen. Ask &#761;them&#762;, “Has He forbidden &#761;to you&#762; the two males or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females? Or were you present when Allah gave you this commandment?” Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah to mislead others without &#761;any&#762; knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(6, 145, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood, swine—which is impure—or a sinful offering in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—then surely your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),
(6, 146, 'For those who are Jewish, We forbade every animal with undivided hoofs and the fat of oxen and sheep except what is joined to their backs or intestines or mixed with bone. In this way We rewarded them for their violations. And We are certainly truthful.'),
(6, 147, 'But if they deny you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, say, “Your Lord is infinite in mercy, yet His punishment will not be averted from the wicked people.”'),
(6, 148, 'The polytheists will argue, “Had it been Allah’s Will, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Him &#761;in worship&#762; or made anything unlawful.” Likewise, those before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? Surely you follow nothing but &#761;false&#762; assumptions and you do nothing but lie.”'),
(6, 149, 'Say, “Allah has the most conclusive argument. Had it been His Will, He would have easily imposed guidance upon all of you.”'),
(6, 150, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.” If they &#761;falsely&#762; testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our proofs, disbelieve in the Hereafter, and set up equals with their Lord.'),
(6, 151, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him &#761;in worship&#762;. &#761;Do not fail to&#762; honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a &#761;human&#762; life—made sacred by Allah—except with &#761;legal&#762; right. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand.'),
(6, 152, 'And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak, maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful.'),
(6, 153, 'Indeed, that is My Path—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be conscious &#761;of Allah&#762;.”'),
(6, 154, 'Additionally, We gave Moses the Scripture, completing the favour upon those who do good, detailing everything, and as a guide and a mercy, so perhaps they would be certain of the meeting with their Lord.'),
(6, 155, 'This is a blessed Book We have revealed. So follow it and be mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, so you may be shown mercy.'),

(7, 21, 'And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.”'),
(7, 22, 'So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise.

(7, 26, 'O children of Adam! We have provided for you clothing to cover your nakedness and as an adornment. However, the best clothing is righteousness. This is one of Allah’s bounties, so perhaps you will be mindful.'),
(7, 27, 'O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve.'),
(7, 28, 'Whenever they commit a shameful deed, they say, “We found our forefathers doing it and Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “No! Allah never commands what is shameful. How can you attribute to Allah what you do not know?”'),
(7, 29, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “My Lord has commanded uprightness and dedication &#761;to Him alone&#762; in worship, calling upon Him with sincere devotion. Just as He first brought you into being, you will be brought to life again.”'),

(7, 31, 'O Children of Adam! Dress properly whenever you are at worship. Eat and drink, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful.'),
(7, 32, 'Ask, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions Allah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment. This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.”'),
(7, 33, 'Say, “My Lord has only forbidden open and secret indecencies, sinfulness, unjust aggression, associating &#761;others&#762; with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;—a practice He has never authorized—and attributing to Allah what you do not know.”'),

(7, 35, 'O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to you reciting My revelations—whoever shuns evil and mends their ways, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),

(7, 38, 'Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the &#761;evil&#762; groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.”'),
(7, 39, 'Then the leaders will say to their followers, “You were no better than us! So taste the torment for what you used to commit.”'),

When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.”'),
(7, 144, 'Allah said, “O Moses! I have &#761;already&#762; elevated you above all others by My messages and speech. So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.”'),
(7, 145, 'We wrote for him on the Tablets &#761;the fundamentals&#762; of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. &#761;We commanded,&#762; “Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it. I will soon show &#761;all of&#762; you the home of the rebellious.'),
(7, 146, 'I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.'),
(7, 147, 'The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting &#761;with Allah&#762; in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?”'),
(7, 148, 'In the absence of Moses, his people made from their &#761;golden&#762; jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the &#761;Right&#762; Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.'),
(7, 149, 'Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.”'),
(7, 150, 'Upon Moses’ return to his people, &#761;totally&#762; furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not &#761;humiliate me and&#762; make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”'),
(7, 151, 'Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”'),
(7, 152, 'Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah’s wrath as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.'),
(7, 153, 'But those who commit evil, then repent and become &#761;true&#762; believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.'),
(7, 154, 'When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.'),
(7, 155, 'Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake, he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.'),
(7, 156, 'Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You &#761;in repentance&#762;.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.'),
(7, 157, '“&#761;They are&#762; the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. &#761;Only&#762; those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.”'),
(7, 158, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To Him &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(7, 159, 'There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.'),
(7, 160, 'We divided them into twelve tribes—each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, &#761;saying&#762;, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” They &#761;certainly&#762; did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.'),
(7, 161, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when it was said to them, “Enter this city &#761;of Jerusalem&#762; and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, &#761;and&#762; We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.”'),
(7, 162, 'But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.'),
(7, 163, 'Ask them &#761;O Prophet&#762; about &#761;the people of&#762; the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath. During the Sabbath, &#761;abundant&#762; fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.'),
(7, 164, 'When some of &#761;the righteous among&#762; them questioned &#761;their fellow Sabbath-keepers&#762;, “Why do you &#761;bother to&#762; warn those &#761;Sabbath-breakers&#762; who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”'),
(7, 165, 'When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.'),
(7, 166, 'But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!”'),
(7, 167, 'And &#761;remember, O Prophet,&#762; when your Lord declared that He would send against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day of Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(7, 168, 'We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return &#761;to the Right Path&#762;.'),
(7, 169, 'Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven &#761;after all&#762;.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the &#761;eternal&#762; Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;. Will you not then understand?'),
(7, 170, 'As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.'),
(7, 171, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them. &#761;We said,&#762; “Hold firmly to that &#761;Scripture&#762; which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.”'),
(7, 172, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. &#761;Allah asked,&#762; “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” &#761;He cautioned,&#762; “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’'),
(7, 173, 'Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others &#761;with Allah in worship&#762; and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”'),
(7, 174, 'This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return &#761;to the Right Path&#762;.'),
(7, 175, 'And relate to them &#761;O Prophet&#762; the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.'),
(7, 176, 'If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it &#761;still&#762; pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate &#761;to them&#762; stories &#761;of the past&#762;, so perhaps they will reflect.'),
(7, 177, 'What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They &#761;only&#762; wronged their own souls.'),
(7, 178, 'Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the &#761;true&#762; losers.'),
(7, 179, 'Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such &#761;people&#762; are &#761;entirely&#762; heedless.'),
(7, 180, 'Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do.'),
(7, 181, 'And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly.'),
(7, 182, 'As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.'),
(7, 183, 'I &#761;only&#762; delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.'),
(7, 184, 'Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning.'),
(7, 185, 'Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this &#761;Quran&#762; would they believe in?'),
(7, 186, 'Whoever Allah allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.'),
(7, 187, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”'),
(7, 188, 'Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”'),
(7, 189, 'He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”'),
(7, 190, 'But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;!'),
(7, 191, 'Do they associate &#761;with Allah&#762; those &#761;idols&#762; which cannot create anything, but are in fact created;'),
(7, 192, 'which cannot help them, or even help themselves?'),
(7, 193, 'And if you &#761;idolaters&#762; call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent.'),
(7, 194, 'Those &#761;idols&#762; you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true!'),
(7, 195, 'Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!'),
(7, 196, '“Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He &#761;alone&#762; protects the righteous.'),
(7, 197, 'But those &#761;false gods&#762; you call besides Him can neither help you nor even themselves.”'),
(7, 198, 'If you &#761;idolaters&#762; call them to guidance, they cannot hear. And you &#761;O Prophet&#762; may see them facing towards you, but they cannot see.'),
(7, 199, 'Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly.'),
(7, 200, 'If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(7, 201, 'Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, they remember &#761;their Lord&#762; then they start to see &#761;things&#762; clearly.'),
(7, 202, 'But the devils persistently plunge their &#761;human&#762; associates deeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.'),
(7, 203, 'If you &#761;O Prophet&#762; do not bring them a sign &#761;which they demanded&#762;, they ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This &#761;Quran&#762; is an insight from your Lord—a guide and a mercy for those who believe.”'),
(7, 204, 'When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.'),
(7, 205, 'Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a moderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of the heedless.'),
(7, 206, 'Surely those &#761;angels&#762; nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate.'),
(8, 1, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are &#761;true&#762; believers.”'),
(8, 2, 'The &#761;true&#762; believers are only those whose hearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, whose faith increases when His revelations are recited to them, and who put their trust in their Lord.'),
(8, 3, '&#761;They are&#762; those who establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them.'),
(8, 4, 'It is they who are the true believers. They will have elevated ranks, forgiveness, and an honourable provision from their Lord.'),
(8, 5, 'Similarly, when your Lord brought you &#761;O Prophet&#762; out of your home for a just cause, a group of believers was totally against it.'),
(8, 6, 'They disputed with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open.'),
(8, 7, '&#761;Remember, O believers,&#762; when Allah promised &#761;to give&#762; you the upper hand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party. But it was Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the disbelievers;'),
(8, 8, 'to firmly establish the truth and wipe out falsehood—even to the dismay of the wicked.'),
(8, 9, '&#761;Remember&#762; when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”'),
(8, 10, 'And Allah made this a sign of victory and reassurance to your hearts. Victory comes only from Allah. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(8, 11, '&#761;Remember&#762; when He caused drowsiness to overcome you, giving you serenity. And He sent down rain from the sky to purify you, free you from Satan’s whispers, strengthen your hearts, and make &#761;your&#762; steps firm.'),
(8, 12, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”'),
(8, 13, 'This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah and His Messenger, then &#761;know that&#762; Allah is surely severe in punishment.'),
(8, 14, 'That &#761;worldly punishment&#762; is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers will suffer the torment of the Fire.'),
(8, 15, 'O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them.'),
(8, 16, 'And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!'),
(8, 17, 'It was not you &#761;believers&#762; who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so. Nor was it you &#761;O Prophet&#762; who threw &#761;a handful of sand at the disbelievers&#762;, but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(8, 18, 'As such, Allah frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.'),
(8, 19, 'If you &#761;Meccans&#762; sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you cease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And your forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you whatsoever. For Allah is certainly with the believers.'),
(8, 20, 'O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear &#761;his call&#762;.'),
(8, 21, 'Do not be like those who say, “We hear,” but in fact they are not listening.'),
(8, 22, 'Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are the &#761;wilfully&#762; deaf and dumb, who do not understand.'),
(8, 23, 'Had Allah known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. &#761;But&#762; even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly.'),
(8, 24, 'O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered.'),
(8, 25, 'Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is severe in punishment.'),
(8, 26, 'Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land, constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful.'),
(8, 27, 'O believers! Do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly.'),
(8, 28, 'And know that your wealth and your children are only a test and that with Allah is a great reward.'),
(8, 29, 'O believers! If you are mindful of Allah, He will grant you a standard &#761;to distinguish between right and wrong&#762;, absolve you of your sins, and forgive you. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.'),
(8, 30, 'And &#761;remember, O Prophet,&#762; when the disbelievers conspired to capture, kill, or exile you. They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is the best of planners.'),
(8, 31, 'Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they challenge &#761;you&#762;, “We have already heard &#761;the recitation&#762;. If we wanted, we could have easily produced something similar. This &#761;Quran&#762; is nothing but ancient fables!”'),
(8, 32, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when they prayed, “O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”'),
(8, 33, 'But Allah would never punish them while you &#761;O Prophet&#762; were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they prayed for forgiveness.'),
(8, 34, 'And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from the Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right to guardianship except those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, but most pagans do not know.'),
(8, 35, 'Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief.'),
(8, 36, 'Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell,'),
(8, 37, 'so Allah may separate the evil from the good. He will pile up the evil ones all together and then cast them into Hell. They are the &#761;true&#762; losers.'),
(8, 38, 'Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them.'),
(8, 39, 'Fight against them until there is no more persecution—and &#761;your&#762; devotion will be entirely to Allah. But if they desist, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.'),
(8, 40, 'And if they do not comply, then know that Allah is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper!'),
(8, 41, 'Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and &#761;needy&#762; travellers, if you &#761;truly&#762; believe in Allah and what We revealed to Our servant on that decisive day when the two armies met &#761;at Badr&#762;. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(8, 42, '&#761;Remember&#762; when you were on the near side of the valley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if the two armies had made an appointment &#761;to meet&#762;, both would have certainly missed it. Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(8, 43, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when Allah showed them in your dream as few in number. Had He shown them to you as many, you &#761;believers&#762; would have certainly faltered and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you &#761;from that&#762;. Surely He knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(8, 44, 'Then when your armies met, Allah made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in theirs, so Allah may establish what He had destined. And to Allah &#761;all&#762; matters will be returned &#761;for judgment&#762;.'),
(8, 45, 'O believers! When you face an enemy, stand firm and remember Allah often so you may triumph.'),
(8, 46, 'Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another, or you would be discouraged and weakened. Persevere! Surely Allah is with those who persevere.'),
(8, 47, 'Do not be like those &#761;pagans&#762; who left their homes arrogantly, only to be seen by people and to hinder others from Allah’s Path. And Allah is Fully Aware of what they do.'),
(8, 48, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Satan made their &#761;evil&#762; deeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But when the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.”'),
(8, 49, '&#761;Remember&#762; when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “These &#761;believers&#762; are deluded by their faith.” But whoever puts their trust in Allah, surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(8, 50, 'If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers, beating their faces and backs, &#761;saying,&#762; “Taste the torment of burning!'),

(8, 52, 'Their fate is that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them—they all disbelieved in Allah’s signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, severe in punishment.'),
(8, 53, 'This is because Allah would never discontinue His favour to a people until they discontinue their faith. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(8, 54, 'That was the case with Pharaoh’s people and those before them—they all rejected the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned Pharaoh’s people. They were all wrongdoers.'),
(8, 55, 'Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are those who persist in disbelief, never to have faith—'),
(8, 56, '&#761;namely&#762; those with whom you &#761;O Prophet&#762; have entered into treaties, but they violate them every time, not fearing the consequences.'),
(8, 57, 'If you ever encounter them in battle, make a fearsome example of them, so perhaps those who would follow them may be deterred.'),
(8, 58, 'And if you &#761;O Prophet&#762; see signs of betrayal by a people, respond by openly terminating your treaty with them. Surely Allah does not like those who betray.'),
(8, 59, 'Do not let those disbelievers think they are not within reach. They will have no escape.'),
(8, 60, 'Prepare against them what you &#761;believers&#762; can of &#761;military&#762; power and cavalry to deter Allah’s enemies and your enemies as well as other enemies unknown to you but known to Allah. Whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be paid to you in full and you will not be wronged.'),
(8, 61, 'If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them. And put your trust in Allah. Indeed, He &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),

(8, 65, 'O Prophet! Motivate the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not comprehend.'),
(8, 66, 'Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there be one thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s Will. And Allah is with the steadfast.'),
(8, 67, 'It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives until he has thoroughly subdued the land. You &#761;believers&#762; settled with the fleeting gains of this world, while Allah’s aim &#761;for you&#762; is the Hereafter. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(8, 68, 'Had it not been for a prior decree from Allah, you would have certainly been disciplined with a tremendous punishment for whatever &#761;ransom&#762; you have taken.'),
(8, 69, 'Now enjoy what you have taken, for it is lawful and good. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),

(8, 71, 'But if their intention is only to betray you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, they sought to betray Allah before. But He gave you power over them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(8, 72, 'Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help &#761;against persecution&#762; in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(8, 73, 'As for the disbelievers, they are guardians of one another. And unless you &#761;believers&#762; act likewise, there will be great oppression and corruption in the land.'),
(8, 74, 'Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of Allah, and those who gave &#761;them&#762; shelter and help, they are the true believers. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.'),
(8, 75, 'And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you, they are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit from one another, as ordained by Allah. Surely Allah has &#761;full&#762; knowledge of everything.'),
(9, 1, '&#761;This is&#762; a discharge from all obligations, by Allah and His Messenger, to the polytheists you &#761;believers&#762; have entered into treaties with:'),
(9, 2, '“You &#761;polytheists&#762; may travel freely through the land for four months, but know that you will have no escape from Allah, and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.”'),
(9, 3, 'A declaration from Allah and His Messenger &#761;is made&#762; to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you &#761;pagans&#762; repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from Allah. And give good news &#761;O Prophet&#762; to the disbelievers of a painful punishment.'),
(9, 4, 'As for the polytheists who have honoured every term of their treaty with you and have not supported an enemy against you, honour your treaty with them until the end of its term. Surely Allah loves those who are mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(9, 5, 'But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists &#761;who violated their treaties&#762; wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 6, 'And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection &#761;O Prophet&#762;, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.'),
(9, 7, 'How can such polytheists have a treaty with Allah and His Messenger, except those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque? So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who are mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(9, 8, 'How &#761;can they have a treaty&#762;? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious.'),
(9, 9, 'They chose a fleeting gain over Allah’s revelations, hindering &#761;others&#762; from His Way. Evil indeed is what they have done!'),
(9, 10, 'They do not honour the bonds of kinship or treaties with the believers. It is they who are the transgressors.'),
(9, 11, 'But if they repent, perform prayer, and pay alms-tax, then they are your brothers in faith. This is how We make the revelations clear for people of knowledge.'),
(9, 12, 'But if they break their oaths after making a pledge and attack your faith, then fight the champions of disbelief—who never honour their oaths—so perhaps they will desist.'),
(9, 13, 'Will you not fight those who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel the Messenger &#761;from Mecca&#762;, and attacked you first? Do you fear them? Allah is more deserving of your fear, if you are &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(9, 14, '&#761;So&#762; fight them and Allah will punish them at your hands, put them to shame, help you overcome them, and soothe the hearts of the believers—'),
(9, 15, 'removing rage from their hearts. And Allah pardons whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 16, 'Do you &#761;believers&#762; think that you will be left without Allah proving who among you &#761;truly&#762; struggles &#761;in His cause&#762; and never takes trusted allies other than Allah, His Messenger, or the believers? And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(9, 17, 'It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever.'),
(9, 18, 'The mosques of Allah should only be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and fear none but Allah. It is right to hope that they will be among the &#761;truly&#762; guided.'),
(9, 19, 'Do you &#761;pagans&#762; consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s sight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(9, 20, 'Those who have believed, emigrated, and strived in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of Allah. It is they who will triumph.'),
(9, 21, 'Their Lord gives them good news of His mercy, pleasure, and Gardens with everlasting bliss,'),
(9, 22, 'to stay there for ever and ever. Surely with Allah is a great reward.'),
(9, 23, 'O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the &#761;true&#762; wrongdoers.'),
(9, 24, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—&#761;if all these&#762; are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His Will. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.”'),
(9, 25, 'Indeed Allah has given you &#761;believers&#762; victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of &#7716;unain when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat.'),
(9, 26, 'Then Allah sent down His reassurance upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers.'),
(9, 27, 'Then afterwards Allah will turn in grace to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 28, 'O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are &#761;spiritually&#762; impure, so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 29, 'Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor comply with what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor embrace the religion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture, until they pay the tax, willingly submitting, fully humbled.'),
(9, 30, 'The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only parroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;?'),
(9, 31, 'They have taken their rabbis and monks as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords besides Allah, even though they were commanded to worship none but One God. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. Glorified is He above what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;!'),
(9, 32, 'They wish to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouths, but Allah will only allow His light to be perfected, even to the dismay of the disbelievers.'),
(9, 33, 'He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with &#761;true&#762; guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to the dismay of the polytheists.'),
(9, 34, 'O believers! Indeed, many rabbis and monks consume people’s wealth wrongfully and hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah. Give good news of a painful torment to those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s cause.'),
(9, 35, 'The Day &#761;will come&#762; when their treasure will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides, and backs branded with it. &#761;It will be said to them,&#762; “This is the treasure you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste what you hoarded!”'),
(9, 36, 'Indeed, the number of months ordained by Allah is twelve—in Allah’s Record since the day He created the heavens and the earth—of which four are sacred. That is the Right Way. So do not wrong one another during these months. And together fight the polytheists as they fight against you together. And know that Allah is with those mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(9, 37, 'Reallocating the sanctity of &#761;these&#762; months is an increase in disbelief, by which the disbelievers are led &#761;far&#762; astray. They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.'),
(9, 38, 'O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to &#761;your&#762; land? Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.'),
(9, 39, 'If you do not march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you with other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(9, 40, '&#761;It does not matter&#762; if you &#761;believers&#762; do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out &#761;of Mecca&#762; and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion, “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you &#761;believers&#762; did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(9, 41, '&#761;O believers!&#762; March forth whether it is easy or difficult for you, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah. That is best for you, if only you knew.'),
(9, 42, 'Had the gain been within reach and the journey shorter, they would have followed you, but the distance seemed too long for them. And they will swear by Allah, “Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you.” They are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying.'),
(9, 43, 'May Allah pardon you &#761;O Prophet&#762;! Why did you give them permission &#761;to stay behind&#762; before those who told the truth were distinguished from those who were lying?'),
(9, 44, 'Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask for exemption from striving with their wealth and their lives. And Allah has perfect knowledge of those who are mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(9, 45, 'No one would ask for exemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts.'),
(9, 46, 'Had they &#761;really&#762; intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said &#761;to them&#762;, “Stay with those &#761;helpless&#762; who remain behind.”'),
(9, 47, 'Had they gone forth with you &#761;believers&#762;, they would have been nothing but trouble for you, and would have scrambled around, seeking to spread discord in your midst. And some of you would have eagerly listened to them. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of the wrongdoers.'),
(9, 48, 'They had already sought to spread discord before and devised every &#761;possible&#762; plot against you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, until the truth came and Allah’s Will prevailed—much to their dismay.'),
(9, 49, 'There are some of them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.” They have already fallen into temptation. And Hell will surely engulf the disbelievers.'),
(9, 50, 'If a blessing befalls you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, they grieve, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We took our precaution in advance,” and turn away, rejoicing.'),
(9, 51, 'Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(9, 52, 'Say, “Are you awaiting anything to befall us except one of the two best things: &#761;victory or martyrdom&#762;? But We are awaiting Allah to afflict you with torment either from Him or at our hands. So keep waiting! We too are waiting with you.”'),
(9, 53, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “&#761;Whether you&#762; donate willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, for you have been a rebellious people.”'),
(9, 54, 'And what prevented their donations from being accepted is that they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger, they never come to prayer except half-heartedly, and they never donate except resentfully.'),
(9, 55, 'So let neither their wealth nor children impress you &#761;O Prophet&#762;. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this worldly life, then their souls will depart while they are disbelievers.'),
(9, 56, 'They swear by Allah that they are part of you, but they are not. They only say so out of fear.'),
(9, 57, 'If only they could find a refuge, or a cave, or any hiding-place, they would rush headlong towards it.'),
(9, 58, 'There are some of them who are critical of your distribution of alms &#761;O Prophet&#762;. If they are given some of it they are pleased, but if not they are enraged.'),
(9, 59, 'If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will grant us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To Allah &#761;alone&#762; we turn with hope.”'),
(9, 60, 'Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted &#761;to the faith&#762;, for &#761;freeing&#762; slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for &#761;needy&#762; travellers. &#761;This is&#762; an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 61, 'And there are others who hurt the Prophet by saying, “He listens to anyone.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “He listens to what is best for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy for those who believe among you.” Those who hurt Allah’s Messenger will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(9, 62, 'They swear by Allah to you &#761;believers&#762; in order to please you, while it is the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger they should seek, if they are &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(9, 63, 'Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace.'),
(9, 64, 'The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Keep mocking! Allah will definitely bring to light what you fear.”'),
(9, 65, 'If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?”'),
(9, 66, 'Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you, We will punish others for their wickedness.'),
(9, 67, 'The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold &#761;what is in&#762; their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious.'),
(9, 68, 'Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment.'),
(9, 69, '&#761;You hypocrites are&#762; like those &#761;disbelievers&#762; before you. They were far superior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they did. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have become void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the &#761;true&#762; losers.'),
(9, 70, 'Have they not received the stories of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them: the people of Noah, ’Âd, and Thamûd, the people of Abraham, the residents of Midian, and the overturned cities &#761;of Lot&#762;? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. Allah would have never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.'),
(9, 71, 'The believers, both men and women, are guardians of one another. They encourage good and forbid evil, establish prayer and pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will be shown Allah’s mercy. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(9, 72, 'Allah has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever, and splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity, and—above all—the pleasure of Allah. That is &#761;truly&#762; the ultimate triumph.'),
(9, 73, 'O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination!'),
(9, 74, 'They swear by Allah that they never said anything &#761;blasphemous&#762;, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out. It is only through resentment that they pay Allah and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them.'),
(9, 75, 'And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.”'),
(9, 76, 'But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently.'),
(9, 77, 'So He caused hypocrisy to plague their hearts until the Day they will meet Him, for breaking their promise to Allah and for their lies.'),
(9, 78, 'Do they not know that Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows their &#761;evil&#762; thoughts and secret talks, and that Allah is the Knower of all unseen?'),
(9, 79, '&#761;There are&#762; those who slander &#761;some of&#762; the believers for donating liberally and mock others for giving only the little they can afford. Allah will throw their mockery back at them, and they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(9, 80, '&#761;It does not matter&#762; whether you &#761;O Prophet&#762; pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people.'),
(9, 81, 'Those &#761;hypocrites&#762; who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah and hated &#761;the prospect of&#762; striving with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They said &#761;to one another&#762;, “Do not march forth in the heat.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “The Fire of Hell is far hotter!” If only they could comprehend!'),
(9, 82, 'So let them laugh a little—they will weep much as a reward for what they have committed.'),
(9, 83, 'If Allah returns you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to a group of them and they ask to go forth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along with me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those &#761;helpless&#762; who remain behind.”'),
(9, 84, 'And do not ever offer &#761;funeral&#762; prayers for any of their dead, nor stand by their grave &#761;at burial&#762;, for they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger and died rebellious.'),
(9, 85, 'And let neither their wealth nor children impress you &#761;O Prophet&#762;. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this world, and &#761;then&#762; their souls will depart while they are disbelievers.'),
(9, 86, 'Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in Allah and struggle along with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt, saying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.”'),
(9, 87, 'They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and their hearts have been sealed so they do not comprehend.'),
(9, 88, 'But the Messenger and the believers with him strived with their wealth and their lives. They will have all the best, and it is they who will be successful.'),
(9, 89, 'Allah has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. That is the ultimate triumph.'),
(9, 90, 'Some nomadic Arabs &#761;also&#762; came with excuses, seeking exemption. And those who were untrue to Allah and His Messenger remained behind &#761;with no excuse&#762;. The unfaithful among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.'),
(9, 91, 'There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or those lacking the means &#761;if they stay behind&#762;, as long as they are true to Allah and His Messenger. There is no blame on the good-doers. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 92, 'Nor &#761;is there any blame on&#762; those who came to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; for mounts, then when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they left with eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to contribute.'),
(9, 93, 'Blame is only on those who seek exemption from you although they have the means. They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not realize &#761;the consequences&#762;.'),
(9, 94, 'They will make excuses to you &#761;believers&#762; when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses, &#761;for&#762; we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about your &#761;true&#762; state &#761;of faith&#762;. Your &#761;future&#762; deeds will be observed by Allah and His Messenger as well. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.”'),
(9, 95, 'When you return, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone—they are truly evil. Hell will be their home as a reward for what they have committed.'),
(9, 96, 'They will swear to you in order to please you. And even if you are pleased with them, Allah will never be pleased with the rebellious people.'),
(9, 97, 'The nomadic Arabs &#761;around Medina&#762; are far worse in disbelief and hypocrisy, and less likely to know the laws revealed by Allah to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 98, 'And among the nomads are those who consider what they donate to be a loss and await your misfortune. May ill-fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(9, 99, 'However, among the nomadic Arabs are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider what they donate as a means of coming closer to Allah and &#761;receiving&#762; the prayers of the Messenger. It will certainly bring them closer. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 100, 'As for the foremost—the first of the Emigrants and the Helpers—and those who follow them in goodness, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph.'),
(9, 101, 'Some of the nomads around you &#761;believers&#762; are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina. They have mastered hypocrisy. They are not known to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;; they are known to Us. We will punish them twice &#761;in this world&#762;, then they will be brought back &#761;to their Lord&#762; for a tremendous punishment.'),
(9, 102, 'Some others have confessed their wrongdoing: they have mixed goodness with evil. It is right to hope that Allah will turn to them in mercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 103, 'Take from their wealth &#761;O Prophet&#762; charity to purify and bless them, and pray for them—surely your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(9, 104, 'Do they not know that Allah alone accepts the repentance of His servants and receives &#761;their&#762; charity, and that Allah alone is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful?'),
(9, 105, 'Tell &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Do as you will. Your deeds will be observed by Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.”'),
(9, 106, 'And some others are left for Allah’s decision, either to punish them or turn to them in mercy. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 107, 'There are also those &#761;hypocrites&#762; who set up a mosque &#761;only&#762; to cause harm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger. They will definitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but Allah bears witness that they are surely liars.'),
(9, 108, 'Do not &#761;O Prophet&#762; ever pray in it. Certainly, a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of your prayers. In it are men who love to be purified. And Allah loves those who purify themselves.'),
(9, 109, 'Which is better: those who laid the foundation of their building on the fear and pleasure of Allah, or those who did so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into the Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(9, 110, 'The building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(9, 111, 'Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is &#761;truly&#762; the ultimate triumph.'),
(9, 112, '&#761;It is the believers&#762; who repent, who are devoted to worship, who praise &#761;their Lord&#762;, who fast, who bow down and prostrate themselves, who encourage good and forbid evil, and who observe the limits set by Allah. And give good news to the believers.'),
(9, 113, 'It is not &#761;proper&#762; for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire.'),
(9, 114, 'As for Abraham’s prayer for his father’s forgiveness, it was only in fulfilment of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of Allah, he broke ties with him. Abraham was truly tender-hearted, forbearing.'),
(9, 115, 'Allah would never consider a people deviant after He has guided them, until He makes clear to them what they must avoid. Surely Allah has &#761;full&#762; knowledge of everything.'),
(9, 116, 'Indeed, to Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And besides Allah you have no guardian or helper.'),
(9, 117, 'Allah has certainly turned in mercy to the Prophet as well as the Emigrants and the Helpers who stood by him in the time of hardship, after the hearts of a group of them had almost faltered. He then accepted their repentance. Surely He is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to them.'),
(9, 118, 'And &#761;Allah has also turned in mercy to&#762; the three who had remained behind, &#761;whose guilt distressed them&#762; until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(9, 119, 'O believers! Be mindful of Allah and be with the truthful.'),
(9, 120, 'It was not &#761;proper&#762; for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.'),
(9, 121, 'And whenever they make a donation, small or large, or cross a valley &#761;in Allah’s cause&#762;—it is written to their credit, so that Allah may grant them the best reward for what they used to do.'),
(9, 122, '&#761;However,&#762; it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they &#761;too&#762; may beware &#761;of evil&#762;.'),
(9, 123, 'O believers! Fight the disbelievers around you and let them find firmness in you. And know that Allah is with those mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.'),
(9, 124, 'Whenever a sûrah is revealed, some of them ask &#761;mockingly&#762;, “Which of you has this increased in faith?” As for the believers, it has increased them in faith and they rejoice.'),
(9, 125, 'But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness, and they die as disbelievers.'),
(9, 126, 'Do they not see that they are tried once or twice every year? Yet they neither repent nor do they learn a lesson.'),
(9, 127, 'Whenever a sûrah is revealed, they look at one another, &#761;saying,&#762; “Is anyone watching you?” Then they slip away. &#761;It is&#762; Allah &#761;Who&#762; has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not comprehend.'),
(9, 128, 'There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers.'),
(9, 129, 'But if they turn away, then say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”'),
(10, 1, '<i>Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom.</i>'),
(10, 2, 'Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, &#761;instructing him,&#762; “Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the disbelievers said, “Indeed, this &#761;man&#762; is clearly a magician!”'),
(10, 3, 'Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair. None can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, so worship Him &#761;alone&#762;. Will you not then be mindful?'),
(10, 4, 'To Him is your return all together. Allah’s promise is &#761;always&#762; true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.'),
(10, 5, 'He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation &#761;of time&#762;. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge.'),

(10, 9, 'Surely those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them &#761;to Paradise&#762; through their faith, rivers will flow under their feet in the Gardens of Bliss,'),
(10, 10, 'in which their prayer will be, “Glory be to You, O Allah!” and their greeting will be, “Peace!” and their closing prayer will be, “All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds!”'),
(10, 11, 'If Allah were to hasten evil for people as they wish to hasten good, they would have certainly been doomed. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their defiance.'),
(10, 12, 'Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them.'),
(10, 13, 'We surely destroyed &#761;other&#762; peoples before you when they did wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they would not believe! This is how We reward the wicked people.'),
(10, 14, 'Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would act.'),
(10, 15, 'When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say &#761;to the Prophet&#762;, “Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.” Say &#761;to them&#762;, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.”'),
(10, 16, 'Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I had lived my whole life among you before this &#761;revelation&#762;. Do you not understand?”'),
(10, 17, 'Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or deny His revelations? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.'),
(10, 18, 'They worship besides Allah others who can neither harm nor benefit them, and say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Are you informing Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;!”'),
(10, 19, 'Humanity was once nothing but a single community &#761;of believers&#762;, but then they differed. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled &#761;at once&#762;.'),
(10, 20, 'They ask, “Why has no &#761;other&#762; sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “&#761;The knowledge of&#762; the unseen is with Allah alone. So wait! I too am waiting with you.”'),
(10, 21, 'When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Allah is swifter in devising &#761;punishment&#762;. Surely Our angels record whatever you devise.”'),
(10, 22, 'He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so happens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the passengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and those on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they assume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah &#761;alone&#762; in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.”'),
(10, 23, 'But as soon as He rescues them, they transgress in the land unjustly. O humanity! Your transgression is only against your own souls. &#761;There is only&#762; brief enjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will inform you of what you used to do.'),
(10, 24, 'The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.'),
(10, 25, 'And Allah invites &#761;all&#762; to the Home of Peace and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.'),
(10, 26, 'Those who do good will have the finest reward and &#761;even&#762; more. Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.'),
(10, 27, 'As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from Allah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(10, 28, '&#761;Consider&#762; the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others &#761;with Allah in worship&#762;, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped!'),
(10, 29, 'Allah is sufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of your worship.”'),
(10, 30, 'Then and there every soul will face &#761;the consequences of&#762; what it had done. They all will be returned to Allah—their True Master. And whatever &#761;gods&#762; they fabricated will fail them.'),

Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will &#761;surely&#762; say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear &#761;Him&#762;?'),
(10, 32, 'That is Allah—your True Lord. So what is beyond the truth except falsehood? How can you then be turned away?”'),
(10, 33, 'And so your Lord’s decree has been proven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe.'),
(10, 34, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Can any of your associate-gods originate creation and then resurrect it?” Say, “&#761;Only&#762; Allah originates creation and then resurrects it. How can you then be deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;?”'),
(10, 35, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the truth?” Say, “&#761;Only&#762; Allah guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the way unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?'),
(10, 36, 'Most of them follow nothing but &#761;inherited&#762; assumptions. &#761;And&#762; surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth. Allah is indeed All-Knowing of what they do.'),
(10, 37, 'It is not &#761;possible&#762; for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds.'),
(10, 38, 'Or do they claim, “He made it up!”? Tell them &#761;O Prophet&#762;, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”'),
(10, 39, 'In fact, they &#761;hastily&#762; rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!'),

It is those &#761;believers&#762; who have faith in it. But whoever from the &#761;disbelieving&#762; groups rejects it, the Fire will be their destiny. So do not be in doubt of it.

(12, 27, 'But if it is torn from the back, then she has lied and he is truthful.”'),
(12, 28, 'So when her husband saw that Joseph’s shirt was torn from the back, he said &#761;to her&#762;, “This must be &#761;an example&#762; of the cunning of you &#761;women&#762;! Indeed, your cunning is so shrewd!'),
(12, 29, 'O Joseph! Forget about this. And you &#761;O wife&#762;! Seek forgiveness for your sin. It certainly has been your fault.”'),
(12, 30, 'Some women of the city gossiped, “The Chief Minister’s wife is trying to seduce her slave-boy. Love for him has plagued her heart. Indeed, we see that she is clearly mistaken.”'),
(12, 31, 'When she heard about their gossip, she invited them and set a banquet for them. She gave each one a knife, then said &#761;to Joseph&#762;, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned &#761;by his beauty&#762; that they cut their hands, and exclaimed, “Good God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel!”'),
(12, 32, 'She said, “This is the one for whose love you criticized me! I did try to seduce him but he &#761;firmly&#762; refused. And if he does not do what I order him to, he will certainly be imprisoned and &#761;fully&#762; disgraced.”'),
(12, 33, 'Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they invite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might yield to them and fall into ignorance.”'),
(12, 34, 'So his Lord responded to him, turning their cunning away from him. Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(12, 35, 'And so it occurred to those in charge, despite seeing all the proofs &#761;of his innocence&#762;, that he should be imprisoned for a while.'),
(12, 36, 'And two other servants went to jail with Joseph. One of them said, “I dreamt I was pressing wine.” The other said, “I dreamt I was carrying &#761;some&#762; bread on my head, from which birds were eating.” &#761;Then both said,&#762; “Tell us their interpretation, for we surely see you as one of the good-doers.”'),
(12, 37, 'Joseph replied, “I can even tell you what kind of meal you will be served before you receive it. This &#761;knowledge&#762; is from what my Lord has taught me. I have shunned the faith of a people who disbelieve in Allah and deny the Hereafter.'),
(12, 38, 'I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not &#761;right&#762; for us to associate anything with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;. This is part of Allah’s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not grateful.'),
(12, 39, 'O my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different lords or Allah—the One, the Supreme?'),
(12, 40, 'Whatever &#761;idols&#762; you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up—a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the upright faith, but most people do not know.'),
(12, 41, '“O my fellow-prisoners! &#761;The first&#762; one of you will serve wine to his master, and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you inquired has been decided.”'),
(12, 42, 'Then he said to the one he knew would survive, “Mention me in the presence of your master.” But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.'),
(12, 43, 'And &#761;one day&#762; the King said, “I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and &#761;seven&#762; others dry. O chiefs! Tell me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret dreams.”'),
(12, 44, 'They replied, “These are confused visions and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.”'),
(12, 45, '&#761;Finally,&#762; the surviving ex-prisoner remembered &#761;Joseph&#762; after a long time and said, “I will tell you its interpretation, so send me forth &#761;to Joseph&#762;.”'),
(12, 46, '&#761;He said,&#762; “Joseph, O man of truth! Interpret for us &#761;the dream of&#762; seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and &#761;seven&#762; others dry, so that I may return to the people and let them know.”'),
(12, 47, 'Joseph replied, “You will plant &#761;grain&#762; for seven consecutive years, leaving in the ear whatever you will harvest, except for the little you will eat.'),
(12, 48, 'Then after that will come seven years of great hardship which will consume whatever you have saved, except the little you will store &#761;for seed&#762;.'),
(12, 49, 'Then after that will come a year in which people will receive abundant rain and they will press &#761;oil and wine&#762;.”'),
(12, 50, 'The King &#761;then&#762; said, “Bring him to me.” When the messenger came to him, Joseph said, “Go back to your master and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. Surely my Lord has &#761;full&#762; knowledge of their cunning.”'),
(12, 51, 'The King asked &#761;the women&#762;, “What did you get when you tried to seduce Joseph?” They replied, “Allah forbid! We know nothing indecent about him.” Then the Chief Minister’s wife admitted, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely truthful.'),
(12, 52, 'From this, Joseph should know that I did not speak dishonestly about him in his absence, for Allah certainly does not guide the scheming of the dishonest.'),
(12, 53, 'And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),
(12, 54, 'The King said, “Bring him to me. I will employ him exclusively in my service.” And when Joseph spoke to him, the King said, “Today you are highly esteemed and fully trusted by us.”'),
(12, 55, 'Joseph proposed, “Put me in charge of the store-houses of the land, for I am truly reliable and adept.”'),
(12, 56, 'This is how We established Joseph in the land to settle wherever he pleased. We shower Our mercy on whoever We will, and We never discount the reward of the good-doers.'),
(12, 57, 'And the reward of the Hereafter is far better for those who are faithful and are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.'),
(12, 58, 'And Joseph’s brothers came and entered his presence. He recognized them but they were unaware of who he really was.'),
(12, 59, 'When he had provided them with their supplies, he demanded, “Bring me your brother on your father’s side. Do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best of hosts?'),
(12, 60, 'But if you do not bring him to me &#761;next time&#762;, I will have no grain for you, nor will you ever come close to me again.”'),
(12, 61, 'They promised, “We will try to convince his father to let him come. We will certainly do &#761;our best&#762;.”'),
(12, 62, 'Joseph ordered his servants to put his brothers’ money back into their saddlebags so that they would find it when they returned to their family and perhaps they would come back.'),
(12, 63, 'When Joseph’s brothers returned to their father, they pleaded, “O our father! We have been denied &#761;further&#762; supplies. So send our brother with us so that we may receive our measure, and we will definitely watch over him.”'),
(12, 64, 'He responded, “Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother &#761;Joseph&#762;? But &#761;only&#762; Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.”'),
(12, 65, 'When they opened their bags, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. They argued, “O our father! What more can we ask for? Here is our money, fully returned to us. Now we can buy more food for our family. We will watch over our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain. That load can be easily secured.”'),
(12, 66, 'Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.”'),
(12, 67, 'He then instructed &#761;them&#762;, “O my sons! Do not enter &#761;the city&#762; all through one gate, but through separate gates. I cannot help you against &#761;what is destined by&#762; Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.”'),
(12, 68, 'Then when they entered as their father had instructed them, this did not help them against &#761;the Will of&#762; Allah whatsoever. It was just a desire in Jacob’s heart which he satisfied. He was truly blessed with &#761;great&#762; knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people have no knowledge.'),
(12, 69, 'When they entered Joseph’s presence, he called his brother &#761;Benjamin&#762; aside, and confided &#761;to him&#762;, “I am indeed your brother &#761;Joseph&#762;! So do not feel distressed about what they have been doing.”'),
(12, 70, 'When Joseph had provided them with supplies, he slipped the royal cup into his brother’s bag. Then a herald cried, “O people of the caravan! You must be thieves!”'),
(12, 71, 'They asked, turning back, “What have you lost?”'),
(12, 72, 'The herald &#761;along with the guards&#762; replied, “We have lost the King’s measuring cup. And whoever brings it will be awarded a camel-load &#761;of grain&#762;. I guarantee it.”'),
(12, 73, 'Joseph’s brothers replied, “By Allah! You know well that we did not come to cause trouble in the land, nor are we thieves.”'),
(12, 74, 'Joseph’s men asked, “What should be the price for theft, if you are lying?”'),
(12, 75, 'Joseph’s brothers responded, “The price will be &#761;the enslavement of&#762; the one in whose bag the cup is found. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.”'),
(12, 76, 'Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother &#761;Benjamin&#762;, then brought it out of Benjamin’s bag. This is how We inspired Joseph to plan. He could not have taken his brother under the King’s law, but Allah had so willed. We elevate in rank whoever We will. But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.'),
(12, 77, '&#761;To distance themselves,&#762; Joseph’s brothers argued, “If he has stolen, so did his &#761;full&#762; brother before.” But Joseph suppressed his outrage—revealing nothing to them—and said &#761;to himself&#762;, “You are in such an evil position, and Allah knows best &#761;the truth of&#762; what you claim.”'),
(12, 78, 'They appealed, “O Chief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We surely see you as one of the good-doers.”'),
(12, 79, 'Joseph responded, “Allah forbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our property. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.”'),
(12, 80, 'When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah from you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not leaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For He is the Best of Judges.'),
(12, 81, 'Return to your father and say, ‘O our father! Your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not guard against the unforeseen.'),
(12, 82, 'Ask &#761;the people of&#762; the land where we were and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.’”'),
(12, 83, 'He cried, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something &#761;evil&#762;. So &#761;I am left with nothing but&#762; beautiful patience! I trust Allah will return them all to me. Surely He &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”'),
(12, 84, 'He turned away from them, lamenting, “Alas, poor Joseph!” And his eyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.'),
(12, 85, 'They said, “By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or &#761;even&#762; your life.”'),
(12, 86, 'He replied, “I complain of my anguish and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.'),
(12, 87, 'O my sons! Go and search &#761;diligently&#762; for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah’s mercy except those with no faith.”'),
(12, 88, 'When they entered Joseph’s presence, they pleaded, “O Chief Minister! We and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought only a few worthless coins, but &#761;please&#762; give us our supplies in full and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.”'),
(12, 89, 'He asked, “Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?”'),
(12, 90, 'They replied &#761;in shock&#762;, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and here is my brother &#761;Benjamin&#762;! Allah has truly been gracious to us. Surely whoever is mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; and patient, then certainly Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.”'),
(12, 91, 'They admitted, “By Allah! Allah has truly preferred you over us, and we have surely been sinful.”'),
(12, 92, 'Joseph said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!'),
(12, 93, 'Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father’s face, and he will regain his sight. Then come back to me with your whole family.”'),
(12, 94, 'When the caravan departed &#761;from Egypt&#762;, their father said &#761;to those around him&#762;, “You may think I am senile, but I certainly sense the smell of Joseph.”'),
(12, 95, 'They replied, “By Allah! You are definitely still in your old delusion.”'),
(12, 96, 'But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the shirt over Jacob’s face, so he regained his sight. Jacob then said &#761;to his children&#762;, “Did I not tell you that I truly know from Allah what you do not know?”'),
(12, 97, 'They begged, “O our father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins. We have certainly been sinful.”'),
(12, 98, 'He said, “I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness. He &#761;alone&#762; is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),
(12, 99, 'When they entered Joseph’s presence, he received his parents &#761;graciously&#762; and said, “Enter Egypt, Allah willing, in security.”'),
(12, 100, 'Then he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to Joseph, who then said, “O my dear father! This is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was truly kind to me when He freed me from prison, and brought you all from the desert after Satan had ignited rivalry between me and my siblings. Indeed my Lord is subtle in fulfilling what He wills. Surely He &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”'),
(12, 101, '“My Lord! You have surely granted me authority and taught me the interpretation of dreams. &#761;O&#762; Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Allow me to die as one who submits and join me with the righteous.”'),
(12, 102, 'That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;. You were not present when they &#761;all&#762; made up their minds, and when they plotted &#761;against Joseph&#762;.'),
(12, 103, 'And most people will not believe—no matter how keen you are—'),
(12, 104, 'even though you are not asking them for a reward for this &#761;Quran&#762;. It is only a reminder to the whole world.'),
(12, 105, 'How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference!'),
(12, 106, 'And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him &#761;in worship&#762;.'),
(12, 107, 'Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect &#761;it&#762;?'),
(12, 108, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight—I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.”'),
(12, 109, 'We only sent before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; men inspired by Us from among the people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land to see what was the end of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them? And surely the &#761;eternal&#762; Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;. Will you not then understand?'),
(12, 110, 'And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them &#761;at last&#762;. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people.'),
(12, 111, 'In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather &#761;it is&#762; a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.'),
(13, 1, '<i>Alif-Lãm-M&#297;m-Ra. These are the verses of the Book. What has been revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.</i>'),
(13, 2, 'It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.'),
(13, 3, 'And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm mountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs. He covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect.'),
(13, 4, 'And on the earth there are &#761;different&#762; neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, &#761;various&#762; crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand.'),
(13, 5, '&#761;Now,&#762; if anything should amaze you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(13, 6, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have &#761;already&#762; been &#761;many&#762; torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment.'),
(13, 7, 'The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” You &#761;O Prophet&#762; are only a warner. And every people had a guide.'),
(13, 8, 'Allah knows what every female bears and what increases and decreases in the wombs. And with Him everything is determined with precision.'),
(13, 9, '&#761;He is the&#762; Knower of the seen and the unseen—the All-Great, Most Exalted.'),
(13, 10, 'It is the same &#761;to Him&#762; whether any of you speaks secretly or openly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad daylight.'),
(13, 11, 'For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state &#761;of favour&#762; until they change their own state &#761;of faith&#762;. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him.'),
(13, 12, 'He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring &#761;you with&#762; hope and fear, and produces heavy clouds.'),
(13, 13, 'The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might.'),
(13, 14, 'Calling upon Him &#761;alone&#762; is the truth. But those &#761;idols&#762; the pagans invoke besides Him &#761;can&#762; never respond to them in any way. &#761;It is&#762; just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, &#761;asking it&#762; to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.'),
(13, 15, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; bow down &#761;in submission&#762; all those in the heavens and the earth—willingly or unwillingly—as do their shadows, morning and evening.'),
(13, 16, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah!” Ask &#761;them&#762;, “Why &#761;then&#762; have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?” Or have they associated with Allah partners who &#761;supposedly&#762; produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”'),
(13, 17, 'He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The &#761;worthless&#762; residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables.'),
(13, 18, 'Those who respond to &#761;the call of&#762; their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest!'),
(13, 19, 'Can the one who knows that your Lord’s revelation to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; is the truth be like the one who is blind? None will be mindful &#761;of this&#762; except people of reason.'),
(13, 20, '&#761;They are&#762; those who honour Allah’s covenant, never breaking the pledge;'),
(13, 21, 'and those who maintain whatever &#761;ties&#762; Allah has ordered to be maintained, stand in awe of their Lord, and fear strict judgment.'),
(13, 22, 'And &#761;they are&#762; those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure, establish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the ultimate abode:'),
(13, 23, 'the Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter along with the righteous among their parents, spouses, and descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, &#761;saying,&#762;'),
(13, 24, '“Peace be upon you for your perseverance. How excellent is the ultimate abode!”'),
(13, 25, 'And those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever &#761;ties&#762; Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode.'),
(13, 26, 'Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of &#761;the pleasures of&#762; this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment.'),
(13, 27, 'The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Indeed, Allah leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him—'),
(13, 28, 'those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort.'),
(13, 29, 'Those who believe and do good, for them will be bliss and an honourable destination.”'),
(13, 30, 'And so We have sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to a community, like &#761;We did with&#762; earlier communities, so that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they deny the Most Compassionate. Say, “He is my Lord! There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. In Him I put my trust, and to Him I turn &#761;in repentance&#762;.”'),
(13, 31, 'If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the earth to split, or the dead to speak, &#761;it would have been this Quran&#762;. But all matters are by Allah’s Will. Have the believers not yet realized that had Allah willed, He could have guided all of humanity? And disasters will continue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their misdeeds, until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Surely Allah never fails in His promise.'),
(13, 32, 'Other messengers had already been ridiculed before you, but I delayed the disbelievers &#761;for a while&#762; then seized them. And how &#761;horrible&#762; was My punishment!'),
(13, 33, 'Is &#761;there any equal to&#762; the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul commits? Yet the pagans have associated others with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Name them! Or do you &#761;mean to&#762; inform Him of something He does not know on the earth? Or are these &#761;gods&#762; just empty words?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to them that they have been turned away from the Path. And whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.'),
(13, 34, 'For them is punishment in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And none can shield them from Allah.'),
(13, 35, 'The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that under it rivers flow; eternal is its fruit as well as its shade. That is the &#761;ultimate&#762; outcome for the righteous. But the outcome for the disbelievers is the Fire!'),
(13, 36, '&#761;The believers among&#762; those who were given the Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, while some &#761;disbelieving&#762; factions deny a portion of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship Allah, associating none with Him &#761;in worship&#762;. To Him I invite &#761;all&#762;, and to Him is my return.”'),
(13, 37, 'And so We have revealed it as an authority in Arabic. And if you were to follow their desires after &#761;all&#762; the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or shield you from Allah.'),
(13, 38, 'We have certainly sent messengers before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; and blessed them with wives and offspring. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s permission. Every destined matter has a &#761;set&#762; time.'),

(14, 4, 'We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people to clarify &#761;the message&#762; for them. Then Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),

(14, 6, '&#761;Consider&#762; when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.'),

(14, 9, 'Have you not &#761;already&#762; received the stories of those who were before you: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah knows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands over their mouths and said, “We totally reject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”'),
(14, 10, 'Their messengers asked &#761;them&#762;, “Is there any doubt about Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He is inviting you in order to forgive your sins, and delay your end until your appointed term.” They argued, “You are no more than humans like us! You &#761;only&#762; wish to turn us away from what our forefathers worshipped. So bring us some compelling proof.”'),
(14, 11, 'Their messengers said to them, “We are &#761;indeed&#762; only humans like you, but Allah favours whoever He chooses of His servants. It is not for us to bring you any proof without Allah’s permission. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(14, 12, 'Why should we not put our trust in Allah, when He has truly guided us to &#761;the very best of&#762; ways? Indeed, we will patiently endure whatever harm you may cause us. And in Allah let the faithful put their trust.”'),
(14, 13, 'The disbelievers then threatened their messengers, “We will certainly expel you from our land, unless you return to our faith.” So their Lord revealed to them, “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers,'),

(14, 20, 'And that is not difficult for Allah &#761;at all&#762;.'),
(14, 21, 'They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly &#761;followers&#762; will appeal to the arrogant &#761;leaders&#762;, “We were your &#761;dedicated&#762; followers, so will you &#761;then&#762; protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. &#761;Now&#762; it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.”'),
(14, 22, 'And Satan will say &#761;to his followers&#762; after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me.

(14, 25, '&#761;always&#762; yielding its fruit in every season by the Will of its Lord. This is how Allah sets forth parables for the people, so perhaps they will be mindful.'),

(14, 27, 'Allah makes the believers steadfast with the firm Word &#761;of faith&#762; in this worldly life and the Hereafter. And Allah leaves the wrongdoers to stray. For Allah does what He wills.'),

(16, 32, 'those whose souls the angels take while they are virtuous, saying &#761;to them&#762;, “Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise for what you used to do.”'),
(16, 33, 'Are they only awaiting the coming of the angels or the command of your Lord &#761;O Prophet&#762;? So were those before them. And Allah never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.'),
(16, 34, 'Then the evil &#761;consequences&#762; of their deeds overtook them, and they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.'),
(16, 35, 'The polytheists argue, “Had Allah willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped anything other than Him, nor prohibited anything without His command.” So did those before them. Is not the messengers’ duty only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly?'),
(16, 36, 'We surely sent a messenger to every community, saying, “Worship Allah and shun false gods.” But some of them were guided by Allah, while others were destined to stray. So travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers!'),
(16, 37, 'Even though you &#761;O Prophet&#762; are keen on their guidance, Allah certainly does not guide those He leaves to stray, and they will have no helpers.'),
(16, 38, 'They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that Allah will never raise the dead to life. Yes &#761;He will&#762;! It is a true promise binding on Him, but most people do not know.'),
(16, 39, '&#761;He will do that&#762; to make clear to them what they disagreed on, and for the disbelievers to know that they were liars.'),
(16, 40, 'If We ever will something &#761;to exist&#762;, all We say is: “Be!” And it is!'),
(16, 41, 'As for those who emigrated in &#761;the cause of&#762; Allah after being persecuted, We will surely bless them with a good home in this world. But the reward of the Hereafter is far better, if only they knew.'),
(16, 42, '&#761;It is&#762; they who have patiently endured, and in their Lord they put their trust.'),
(16, 43, 'We did not send &#761;messengers&#762; before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; except mere men inspired by Us. If you &#761;polytheists&#762; do not know &#761;this already&#762;, then ask those who have knowledge &#761;of the Scriptures&#762;.'),
(16, 44, '&#761;We sent them&#762; with clear proofs and divine Books. And We have sent down to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; the Reminder, so that you may explain to people what has been revealed for them, and perhaps they will reflect.'),
(16, 45, 'Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them? Or that the torment will not come upon them in ways they cannot comprehend?'),

(16, 49, 'And to Allah &#761;alone&#762; bows down &#761;in submission&#762; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of living creatures, as do the angels—who are not too proud &#761;to do so&#762;.'),
(16, 50, 'They fear their Lord above them, and do whatever they are commanded.'),
(16, 51, 'And Allah has said, “Do not take two gods. There is only One God. So be in awe of Me &#761;alone&#762;.”'),
(16, 52, 'To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him &#761;alone&#762; is the everlasting devotion. Will you then fear any other than Allah?'),
(16, 53, 'Whatever blessings you have are from Allah. Then whenever hardship touches you, to Him &#761;alone&#762; you cry &#761;for help&#762;.'),

(16, 57, 'And they attribute &#761;angels as&#762; daughters to Allah—glory be to Him!—the opposite of what they desire for themselves.'),
(16, 58, 'Whenever one of them is given the good news of a baby girl, his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage.'),
(16, 59, 'He hides himself from the people because of the bad news he has received. Should he keep her in disgrace, or bury her &#761;alive&#762; in the ground? Evil indeed is their judgment!'),
(16, 60, 'To those who disbelieve in the Hereafter belong all evil qualities, whereas to Allah belong the finest attributes. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(16, 61, 'If Allah were to punish people &#761;immediately&#762; for their wrongdoing, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it.'),
(16, 62, 'They attribute to Allah what they hate &#761;for themselves&#762;, and their tongues utter the lie that they will have the finest reward. Without a doubt, for them is the Fire, where they will be abandoned.'),
(16, 63, 'By Allah! We have surely sent messengers to communities before you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, but Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. So he is their patron today, and they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(16, 64, 'We have revealed to you the Book only to clarify for them what they differed about, and as a guide and mercy for those who believe.'),
(16, 65, 'And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death. Surely in this is a sign for those who listen.'),
(16, 66, 'And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle: We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, from between digested food and blood: pure milk, pleasant to drink.'),
(16, 67, 'And from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome provision. Surely in this is a sign for those who understand.'),
(16, 68, 'And your Lord inspired the bees: “Make &#761;your&#762; homes in the mountains, the trees, and in what people construct,'),
(16, 69, 'and feed from &#761;the flower of&#762; any fruit &#761;you please&#762; and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.” From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect.'),
(16, 70, 'Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable.'),
(16, 71, 'And Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision. But those who have been much favoured would not share their wealth with those &#761;bondspeople&#762; in their possession, making them their equals. Do they then deny Allah’s favours?'),
(16, 72, 'And Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind, and given you through your spouses children and grandchildren. And He has granted you good, lawful provisions. Are they then faithful to falsehood and ungrateful for Allah’s favours?'),
(16, 73, 'Yet they worship besides Allah those &#761;idols&#762; who do not afford them any provision from the heavens and the earth, nor do they have the power to.'),
(16, 74, 'So do not set up equals to Allah, for Allah certainly knows and you do not know.'),
(16, 75, 'Allah sets forth a parable: a slave who lacks all means, compared to a &#761;free&#762; man to whom We granted a good provision, of which he donates &#761;freely,&#762; openly and secretly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. In fact, most of them do not know.'),
(16, 76, 'And Allah sets forth a parable of two men: one of them is dumb, incapable of anything. He is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent, he brings no good. Can such a person be equal to the one who commands justice and is on the Straight Path?'),
(16, 77, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs &#761;the knowledge of&#762; the unseen in the heavens and the earth. Bringing about the Hour would only take the blink of an eye, or even less. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(16, 78, 'And Allah brought you out of the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing, and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect so perhaps you would be thankful.'),
(16, 79, 'Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe.'),
(16, 80, 'And Allah has made your homes a place to rest, and has given you tents from the hide of animals, light to handle when you travel and when you camp. And out of their wool, fur, and hair He has given you furnishings and goods for a while.'),
(16, 81, 'And Allah has provided you shade out of what He created, and has given you shelter in the mountains. He has also provided you with clothes protecting you from the heat &#761;and cold&#762;, and armour shielding you in battle. This is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will &#761;fully&#762; submit &#761;to Him&#762;.'),
(16, 82, 'But if they turn away, then your duty &#761;O Prophet&#762; is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly.'),
(16, 83, 'They are aware of Allah’s favours, but still deny them. And most of them are &#761;truly&#762; ungrateful.'),
(16, 84, '&#761;Consider, O Prophet,&#762; the Day We will call &#761;a prophet as&#762; a witness from every faith-community. Then the disbelievers will neither be allowed to plead nor appease &#761;their Lord&#762;.'),
(16, 85, 'And when the wrongdoers face the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be delayed &#761;from it&#762;.'),
(16, 86, 'And when the polytheists see their associate-gods, they will say, “Our Lord! These are our associate-gods that we used to invoke besides You.” Their gods will throw a rebuttal at them, &#761;saying,&#762; “You are definitely liars.”'),
(16, 87, 'They will offer &#761;full&#762; submission to Allah on that Day, and whatever &#761;gods&#762; they fabricated will fail them.'),
(16, 88, 'For those who disbelieve and hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah, We will add more punishment to their punishment for all the corruption they spread.'),
(16, 89, '&#761;Consider, O Prophet,&#762; the Day We will call against every faith-community a witness of their own. And We will call you to be a witness against these &#761;people of yours&#762;. We have revealed to you the Book as an explanation of all things, a guide, a mercy, and good news for those who &#761;fully&#762; submit.'),
(16, 90, 'Indeed, Allah commands justice, grace, as well as courtesy to close relatives. He forbids indecency, wickedness, and aggression. He instructs you so perhaps you will be mindful.'),
(16, 91, 'Honour Allah’s covenant when you make a pledge, and do not break your oaths after confirming them, having made Allah your guarantor. Surely Allah knows all you do.'),
(16, 92, 'Do not be like the woman who &#761;foolishly&#762; unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you.'),
(16, 93, 'Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community &#761;of believers&#762;, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills. And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do.'),
(16, 94, 'And do not take your oaths as a means of deceiving one another or your feet will slip after they have been firm. Then you will taste the evil &#761;consequences&#762; of hindering &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah, and you will suffer a tremendous punishment.'),
(16, 95, 'And do not trade Allah’s covenant for a fleeting gain. What is with Allah is certainly far better for you, if only you knew.'),
(16, 96, 'Whatever you have will end, but whatever Allah has is everlasting. And We will certainly reward the steadfast according to the best of their deeds.'),
(16, 97, 'Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, We will surely bless them with a good life, and We will certainly reward them according to the best of their deeds.'),

(17, 57, '&#761;Even&#762; the closest &#761;to Allah&#762; of those invoked would be seeking a way to their Lord, hoping for His mercy, and fearing His punishment. Indeed, your Lord’s torment is fearsome.'),

(17, 59, 'Nothing keeps Us from sending the &#761;demanded&#762; signs except that they had &#761;already&#762; been denied by earlier peoples. And We gave Thamûd the she-camel as a clear sign, but they wrongfully rejected it. We only send the signs as a warning.'),
(17, 60, 'And &#761;remember, O Prophet&#762; when We told you, “Certainly your Lord encompasses the people.” And We have made what We brought you to see as well as the cursed tree &#761;mentioned&#762; in the Quran only as a test for the people. We keep warning them, but it only increases them greatly in defiance.'),
(17, 61, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who protested, “Should I prostrate to the one You have created from mud?”'),

(17, 73, 'They definitely &#761;thought they&#762; were about to lure you away from what We have revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, hoping that you would attribute something else to Us falsely—and then they would have certainly taken you as a close friend.'),
(17, 74, 'Had We not made you steadfast, you probably would have inclined to them a little,'),

(17, 94, 'And nothing has prevented people from believing when guidance comes to them except their protest: “Has Allah sent a human as a messenger?”'),
(17, 95, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We would have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a messenger.”'),

(17, 100, 'Say &#761;to them, O Prophet&#762;, “Even if you were to possess the &#761;infinite&#762; treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold &#761;them&#762;, fearing they would run out—for humankind is ever stingy!”'),
(17, 101, 'We surely gave Moses nine clear signs. &#761;You, O Prophet, can&#762; ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I really think that you, O Moses, are bewitched.”'),

(17, 103, 'So Pharaoh wanted to scare the Israelites out of the land &#761;of Egypt&#762;, but We drowned him and all of those with him.'),
(17, 104, 'And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh, “Reside in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We will bring you all together.”'),
(17, 105, 'We have sent down the Quran in truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; only as a deliverer of good news and a warner.'),

(17, 107, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Believe in this &#761;Quran&#762;, or do not. Indeed, when it is recited to those who were gifted with knowledge before it &#761;was revealed&#762;, they fall upon their faces in prostration,'),
(17, 108, 'and say, ‘Glory be to our Lord! Surely the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.’'),
(17, 109, 'And they fall down upon their faces weeping, and it increases them in humility.”'),
(17, 110, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate—whichever you call, He has the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between.'),
(17, 111, 'And say, “All praise is for Allah, Who has never had &#761;any&#762; offspring; nor does He have a partner in &#761;governing&#762; the kingdom; nor is He pathetic, needing a protector. And revere Him immensely.”'),
(18, 1, 'All praise is for Allah Who has revealed the Book to His servant, allowing no crookedness in it,'),
(18, 2, '&#761;making it&#762; perfectly upright, to warn &#761;the disbelievers&#762; of a severe torment from Him; to give good news to the believers—who do good—that they will have a fine reward,'),
(18, 3, 'in which they will remain forever;'),
(18, 4, 'and to warn those who claim, “Allah has offspring.”'),
(18, 5, 'They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies.'),
(18, 6, 'Now, perhaps you &#761;O Prophet&#762; will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they &#761;continue to&#762; disbelieve in this message.'),
(18, 7, 'We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds.'),
(18, 8, 'And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to barren ground.'),
(18, 9, 'Have you &#761;O Prophet&#762; thought that the people of the cave and the plaque were &#761;the only&#762; wonders of Our signs?'),
(18, 10, '&#761;Remember&#762; when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.”'),
(18, 11, 'So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep in the cave for many years,'),
(18, 12, 'then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay.'),
(18, 13, 'We relate to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.'),
(18, 14, 'And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”'),
(18, 15, '&#761;Then they said to one another,&#762; “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah?'),
(18, 16, 'Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.”'),
(18, 17, 'And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space. That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor.'),
(18, 18, 'And you would have thought they were awake, though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.'),
(18, 19, 'And so We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them exclaimed, “How long have you remained &#761;asleep&#762;?” Some replied, “Perhaps a day, or part of a day.” They said &#761;to one another&#762;, “Your Lord knows best how long you have remained. So send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the purest, and then bring you provisions from it. Let him be &#761;exceptionally&#762; cautious, and do not let him give you away.'),
(18, 20, 'For, indeed, if they find out about you, they will stone you &#761;to death&#762;, or force you back into their faith, and then you will never succeed.”'),
(18, 21, 'That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise &#761;of resurrection&#762; is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth &#761;after their death&#762;, some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”'),
(18, 22, 'Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” &#761;only&#762; guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “My Lord knows best their &#761;exact&#762; number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge, nor consult any of those &#761;who debate&#762; about them.'),
(18, 23, 'And never say of anything, “I will definitely do this tomorrow,”'),
(18, 24, 'without adding, “if Allah so wills!” But if you forget, then remember your Lord, and say, “I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than this.”'),
(18, 25, 'They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.'),
(18, 26, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him &#761;alone&#762; is &#761;the knowledge of&#762; the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How perfectly He hears and sees! They have no guardian besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”'),
(18, 27, 'Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, nor can you find any refuge besides Him.'),
(18, 28, 'And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow &#761;only&#762; their desires and whose state is &#761;total&#762; loss.'),
(18, 29, 'And say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “&#761;This is&#762; the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will &#761;completely&#762; surround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like molten metal, which will burn &#761;their&#762; faces. What a horrible drink! And what a terrible place to rest!'),
(18, 30, 'As for those who believe and do good, We certainly never deny the reward of those who are best in deeds.'),
(18, 31, 'It is they who will have the Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade, reclining there on &#761;canopied&#762; couches. What a marvellous reward! And what a fabulous place to rest!'),
(18, 32, 'Give them &#761;O Prophet&#762; an example of two men. To &#761;the disbelieving&#762; one We gave two gardens of grapevines, which We surrounded with palm trees and placed &#761;various&#762; crops in between.'),
(18, 33, 'Each garden yielded &#761;all&#762; its produce, never falling short. And We caused a river to flow between them.'),
(18, 34, 'And he had other resources &#761;as well&#762;. So he boasted to a &#761;poor&#762; companion of his, while conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and superior in manpower.”'),
(18, 35, 'And he entered his property, while wronging his soul, saying, “I do not think this will ever perish,'),
(18, 36, 'nor do I think the Hour will &#761;ever&#762; come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, I will definitely get a far better outcome than &#761;all&#762; this.”'),
(18, 37, 'His &#761;believing&#762; companion replied, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in the One Who created you from dust, then &#761;developed you&#762; from a sperm-drop, then formed you into a man?'),
(18, 38, 'But as for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I will never associate anyone with my Lord &#761;in worship&#762;.'),
(18, 39, 'If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is what Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though you see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring,'),
(18, 40, 'perhaps my Lord will grant me &#761;something&#762; better than your garden, and send down upon your garden a thunderbolt from the sky, turning it into a barren waste.'),
(18, 41, 'Or its water may sink &#761;into the earth&#762;, and then you will never be able to seek it out.”'),
(18, 42, 'And so all his produce was &#761;totally&#762; ruined, so he started to wring his hands for all he had spent on it, while it had collapsed on its trellises. He cried, “Alas! I wish I had never associated anyone with my Lord &#761;in worship&#762;!”'),
(18, 43, 'And he had no manpower to help him against Allah, nor could he &#761;even&#762; help himself.'),
(18, 44, 'At this time, support comes &#761;only&#762; from Allah—the True &#761;Lord&#762;. He is best in reward and best in outcome.'),
(18, 45, 'And give them a parable of this worldly life. &#761;It is&#762; like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then they &#761;soon&#762; turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable of &#761;doing&#762; all things.'),
(18, 46, 'Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in hope.'),
(18, 47, '&#761;Beware of&#762; the Day We will blow the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare. And We will gather all &#761;humankind&#762;, leaving none behind.'),
(18, 48, 'They will be presented before your Lord in rows, &#761;and the deniers will be told,&#762; “You have surely returned to Us &#761;all alone&#762; as We created you the first time, although you &#761;always&#762; claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.”'),
(18, 49, 'And the record &#761;of deeds&#762; will be laid &#761;open&#762;, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is &#761;written&#762; in it. They will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present &#761;before them&#762;. And your Lord will never wrong anyone.'),
(18, 50, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers &#761;to choose&#762;!'),
(18, 51, 'I never called them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth or &#761;even&#762; their own creation, nor would I take the misleaders as helpers.'),
(18, 52, 'And &#761;beware of&#762; the Day He will say, “Call upon those you claimed were My associate-gods.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And We will make them &#761;all&#762; share in the same doom.'),
(18, 53, 'The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it.'),
(18, 54, 'We have surely set forth in this Quran every &#761;kind of&#762; lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings.'),
(18, 55, 'And nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness except &#761;their demand&#762; to meet the same fate of earlier deniers or that the torment would confront them face to face.'),
(18, 56, 'We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, &#761;hoping&#762; to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings.'),
(18, 57, 'And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this &#761;Quran&#762;—and deafness in their ears. And if you &#761;O Prophet&#762; invite them to &#761;true&#762; guidance, they will never be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(18, 58, 'Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them &#761;immediately&#762; for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge.'),
(18, 59, 'Those &#761;are the&#762; societies We destroyed when they persisted in wrong, and We had set a time for their destruction.'),
(18, 60, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses said to his young assistant, “I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages.”'),
(18, 61, 'But when they &#761;finally&#762; reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their &#761;salted&#762; fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away &#761;wondrously&#762;.'),
(18, 62, 'When they had passed further, he said to his assistant, “Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today’s journey.”'),
(18, 63, 'He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? &#761;That is when&#762; I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”'),
(18, 64, 'Moses responded, “That is &#761;exactly&#762; what we were looking for.” So they returned, retracing their footsteps.'),
(18, 65, 'There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.'),
(18, 66, 'Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?”'),
(18, 67, 'He said, “You certainly cannot be patient &#761;enough&#762; with me.'),
(18, 68, 'And how can you be patient with what is beyond your &#761;realm of&#762; knowledge?”'),
(18, 69, 'Moses assured &#761;him&#762;, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.”'),
(18, 70, 'He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I &#761;myself&#762; clarify it for you.”'),
(18, 71, 'So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!”'),
(18, 72, 'He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?”'),
(18, 73, 'Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.”'),
(18, 74, 'So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.”'),
(18, 75, 'He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?”'),
(18, 76, 'Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.”'),
(18, 77, 'So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.”'),
(18, 78, 'He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently.'),
(18, 79, '“As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a &#761;tyrant&#762; king ahead of them who seizes every &#761;good&#762; ship by force.'),
(18, 80, '“And as for the boy, his parents were &#761;true&#762; believers, and we feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.'),
(18, 81, 'So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place.'),
(18, 82, '“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it &#761;all&#762; on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.”'),
(18, 83, 'They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about &#11371;ul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you something of his narrative.”'),
(18, 84, 'Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things.'),
(18, 85, 'So he travelled a course,'),
(18, 86, 'until he reached the setting &#761;point&#762; of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O &#11371;ul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.”'),
(18, 87, 'He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment.'),
(18, 88, 'As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.”'),
(18, 89, 'Then he travelled a &#761;different&#762; course'),
(18, 90, 'until he reached the rising &#761;point&#762; of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.'),
(18, 91, 'So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him.'),
(18, 92, 'Then he travelled a &#761;third&#762; course'),
(18, 93, 'until he reached &#761;a pass&#762; between two mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly understand &#761;his&#762; language.'),
(18, 94, 'They pleaded, “O &#11371;ul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?”'),
(18, 95, 'He responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them.'),
(18, 96, 'Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up &#761;the gap&#762; between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”'),
(18, 97, 'And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it.'),
(18, 98, 'He declared, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.”'),
(18, 99, 'On that Day, We will let them surge &#761;like waves&#762; over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather all &#761;people&#762; together.'),
(18, 100, 'On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers,'),
(18, 101, 'those who turned a blind eye to My Reminder and could not stand listening &#761;to it&#762;.'),
(18, 102, 'Do the disbelievers think they can &#761;simply&#762; take My servants as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an accommodation for the disbelievers.'),
(18, 103, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most deeds?'),
(18, 104, '&#761;They are&#762; those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!”'),
(18, 105, 'It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day.'),
(18, 106, 'That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers.'),
(18, 107, 'Indeed, those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of Paradise as an accommodation,'),
(18, 108, 'where they will be forever, never desiring anywhere else.'),
(18, 109, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “If the ocean were ink for &#761;writing&#762; the Words of my Lord, it would certainly run out before the Words of my Lord were finished, even if We refilled it with its equal.”'),
(18, 110, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I am only a man like you, &#761;but&#762; it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.”'),

(19, 4, 'saying, “My Lord! Surely my bones have become brittle, and grey hair has spread across my head, but I have never been disappointed in my prayer to You, my Lord!'),
(19, 5, 'And I am concerned about &#761;the faith of&#762; my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So grant me, by Your grace, an heir,'),

(19, 7, '&#761;The angels announced,&#762; “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of &#761;the birth of&#762; a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”'),
(19, 8, 'He wondered, “My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have become extremely old?”'),
(19, 9, 'An angel replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, just as I created you before, when you were nothing!’”'),
(19, 10, 'Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant me a sign.” He responded, “Your sign is that you will not &#761;be able to&#762; speak to people for three nights, despite being healthy.”'),
(19, 11, 'So he came out to his people from the sanctuary, signalling to them to glorify &#761;Allah&#762; morning and evening.'),
(19, 12, '&#761;It was later said,&#762; “O John! Hold firmly to the Scriptures.” And We granted him wisdom while &#761;he was still&#762; a child,'),
(19, 13, 'as well as purity and compassion from Us. And he was God-fearing,'),
(19, 14, 'and kind to his parents. He was neither arrogant nor disobedient.'),
(19, 15, 'Peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day of his death, and the day he will be raised back to life!'),
(19, 16, 'And mention in the Book &#761;O Prophet, the story of&#762; Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the east,'),
(19, 17, 'screening herself off from them. Then We sent to her Our angel, &#761;Gabriel,&#762; appearing before her as a man, perfectly formed.'),
(19, 18, 'She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! &#761;So leave me alone&#762; if you are God-fearing.”'),
(19, 19, 'He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, &#761;sent&#762; to bless you with a pure son.”'),
(19, 20, 'She wondered, “How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?”'),
(19, 21, 'He replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter &#761;already&#762; decreed.”'),
(19, 22, 'So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place.'),
(19, 23, 'Then the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!”'),
(19, 24, 'So a voice reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream at your feet.'),
(19, 25, 'And shake the trunk of this palm tree towards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you.'),
(19, 26, 'So eat and drink, and put your heart at ease. But if you see any of the people, say, ‘I have vowed silence to the Most Compassionate, so I am not talking to anyone today.’”'),
(19, 27, 'Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said &#761;in shock&#762;, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing!'),
(19, 28, 'O sister of Aaron! Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”'),
(19, 29, 'So she pointed to the baby. They exclaimed, “How can we talk to someone who is an infant in the cradle?”'),
(19, 30, 'Jesus declared, “I am truly a servant of Allah. He has destined me to be given the Scripture and to be a prophet.'),

(19, 43, 'O dear father! I have certainly received some knowledge which you have not received, so follow me and I will guide you to the Straight Path.'),
(19, 44, 'O dear father! Do not worship Satan. Surely Satan is ever rebellious against the Most Compassionate.'),

(19, 47, 'Abraham responded, “Peace be upon you! I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness. He has truly been Most Gracious to me.'),

(19, 49, 'So after he had left them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet.'),

(19, 54, 'And mention in the Book &#761;O Prophet, the story of&#762; Ishmael. He was truly a man of his word, and was a messenger and a prophet.'),
(19, 55, 'He used to urge his people to pray and give alms-tax. And his Lord was well pleased with him.'),
(19, 56, 'And mention in the Book &#761;O Prophet, the story of&#762; Enoch. He was surely a man of truth and a prophet.'),
(19, 57, 'And We elevated him to an honourable status.'),
(19, 58, 'Those were &#761;some of&#762; the prophets who Allah has blessed from among the descendants of Adam, and of those We carried with Noah &#761;in the Ark&#762;, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those We &#761;rightly&#762; guided and chose.

(19, 78, 'Has he looked into the unseen or taken a pledge from the Most Compassionate?'),

(20, 57, 'He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?'),
(20, 58, 'We can surely meet you with similar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to keep, in a central place.”'),
(20, 59, 'Moses said, “Your appointment is on the Day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered mid-morning.”'),
(20, 60, 'Pharaoh then withdrew, orchestrated his scheme, then returned.'),
(20, 61, 'Moses warned the magicians, “Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah, or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates &#761;lies&#762; is bound to fail.”'),
(20, 62, 'So the magicians disputed the matter among themselves, conversing privately.'),
(20, 63, 'They concluded, “These two are only magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do away with your most cherished traditions.'),
(20, 64, 'So orchestrate your plan, then come forward in &#761;perfect&#762; ranks. And whoever prevails today will certainly be successful.”'),
(20, 65, 'They said, “O Moses! Either you cast, or let us be the first to cast.”'),
(20, 66, 'Moses responded, “No, you go first.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him—by their magic—to be slithering.'),
(20, 67, 'So Moses concealed fear within himself.'),
(20, 68, 'We reassured &#761;him&#762;, “Do not fear! It is certainly you who will prevail.'),
(20, 69, 'Cast what is in your right hand, and it will swallow up what they have made, for what they have made is no more than a magic trick. And magicians can never succeed wherever they go.”'),
(20, 70, 'So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”'),
(20, 71, 'Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.”'),
(20, 72, 'They responded, “By the One Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the &#761;fleeting&#762; life of this world.'),
(20, 73, 'Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He may forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And Allah is far superior &#761;in reward&#762; and more lasting &#761;in punishment&#762;.”'),
(20, 74, 'Whoever comes to their Lord as an evildoer will certainly have Hell, where they can neither live nor die.'),
(20, 75, 'But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done good, they will have the highest ranks:'),
(20, 76, 'the Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. That is the reward of those who purify themselves.'),
(20, 77, 'And We surely inspired Moses, &#761;saying,&#762; “Leave with My servants &#761;at night&#762; and strike a dry passage for them across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be concerned &#761;of drowning&#762;.”'),
(20, 78, 'Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers—but how overwhelming were the waters that submerged them!'),
(20, 79, 'And &#761;so&#762; Pharaoh led his people astray, and did not guide &#761;them rightly&#762;.'),
(20, 80, 'O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you on the right side of Mount &#7788;ûr, and sent down to you manna and quails,'),
(20, 81, '&#761;saying,&#762; “Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not transgress in them, or My wrath will befall you. And whoever My wrath befalls is certainly doomed.'),
(20, 82, 'But I am truly Most Forgiving to whoever repents, believes, and does good, then persists on &#761;true&#762; guidance.”'),
(20, 83, '&#761;Allah asked,&#762; “Why have you come with such haste ahead of your people, O Moses?”'),
(20, 84, 'He replied, “They are close on my tracks. And I have hastened to You, my Lord, so You will be pleased.”'),
(20, 85, 'Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Sâmiri has led them astray.”'),
(20, 86, 'So Moses returned to his people, furious and sorrowful. He said, “O my people! Had your Lord not made you a good promise? Has my absence been too long for you? Or have you wished for wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me?”'),
(20, 87, 'They argued, “We did not break our promise to you of our own free will, but we were made to carry the burden of the people’s &#761;golden&#762; jewellery, then we threw it &#761;into the fire&#762;, and so did the Sâmiri.”'),
(20, 88, 'Then he moulded for them an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. They said, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses forgot &#761;where it was&#762;!”'),
(20, 89, 'Did they not see that it did not respond to them, nor could it protect or benefit them?'),
(20, 90, 'Aaron had already warned them beforehand, “O my people! You are only being tested by this, for indeed your &#761;one true&#762; Lord is the Most Compassionate. So follow me and obey my orders.”'),
(20, 91, 'They replied, “We will not cease to worship it until Moses returns to us.”'),
(20, 92, 'Moses scolded &#761;his brother&#762;, “O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray,'),
(20, 93, 'from following after me? How could you disobey my orders?”'),
(20, 94, 'Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or &#761;the hair of&#762; my head. I really feared that you would say, ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and did not observe my word.’”'),
(20, 95, 'Moses then asked, “What did you think you were doing, O Sâmiri?”'),
(20, 96, 'He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful &#761;of dust&#762; from the hoof-prints of &#761;the horse of&#762; the messenger-angel &#761;Gabriel&#762; then cast it &#761;on the moulded calf&#762;. This is what my lower-self tempted me into.”'),
(20, 97, 'Moses said, “Go away then! And for &#761;the rest of your&#762; life you will surely be crying, ‘Do not touch &#761;me&#762;!’ Then you will certainly have a fate that you cannot escape. Now look at your god to which you have been devoted: we will burn it up, then scatter it in the sea completely.”'),
(20, 98, '&#761;Then Moses addressed his people,&#762; “Your only god is Allah, there is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. He encompasses everything in &#761;His&#762; knowledge.”'),
(20, 99, 'This is how We relate to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; some of the stories of the past. And We have certainly granted you a Reminder from Us.'),
(20, 100, 'Whoever turns away from it will surely bear the burden &#761;of sin&#762; on the Day of Judgment,'),
(20, 101, 'suffering its consequences forever. What an evil burden they will carry on Judgment Day!'),
(20, 102, '&#761;Beware of&#762; the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced &#761;from horror and thirst&#762;.'),
(20, 103, 'They will whisper among themselves, “You stayed no more than ten days &#761;on the earth&#762;.”'),
(20, 104, 'We know best what they will say—the most reasonable of them will say, “You stayed no more than a day.”'),
(20, 105, 'And &#761;if&#762; they ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about the mountains, &#761;then&#762; say, “My Lord will wipe them out completely,'),
(20, 106, 'leaving the earth level and bare,'),
(20, 107, 'with neither depressions nor elevations to be seen.”'),
(20, 108, 'On that Day all will follow the caller &#761;for assembly&#762;, &#761;and&#762; none will dare to deviate. All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate. Only whispers will be heard.'),
(20, 109, 'On that Day no intercession will be of any benefit, except by those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are agreeable to Him.'),
(20, 110, 'He &#761;fully&#762; knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but they cannot encompass Him in &#761;their&#762; knowledge.'),
(20, 111, 'And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. And those burdened with wrongdoing will be in loss.'),
(20, 112, 'But whoever does good and is a believer will have no fear of being wronged or denied &#761;their reward&#762;.'),
(20, 113, 'And so We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran and varied the warnings in it, so perhaps they will shun evil or it may cause them to be mindful.'),
(20, 114, 'Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite &#761;a revelation of&#762; the Quran &#761;O Prophet&#762; before it is &#761;properly&#762; conveyed to you, and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”'),
(20, 115, 'And indeed, We once made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot, and &#761;so&#762; We did not find determination in him.'),
(20, 116, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused &#761;arrogantly&#762;.'),
(20, 117, 'So We cautioned, “O Adam! This is surely an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him drive you both out of Paradise, for you &#761;O Adam&#762; would then suffer &#761;hardship&#762;.'),
(20, 118, 'Here it is guaranteed that you will never go hungry or unclothed,'),
(20, 119, 'nor will you &#761;ever&#762; suffer from thirst or &#761;the sun’s&#762; heat.”'),
(20, 120, 'But Satan whispered to him, saying, “O Adam! Shall I show you the Tree of Immortality and a kingdom that does not fade away?”'),
(20, 121, 'So they both ate from the tree and then their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. So Adam disobeyed his Lord, and &#761;so&#762; lost his way.'),
(20, 122, 'Then his Lord chose him &#761;for His grace&#762;, accepted his repentance, and guided him &#761;rightly&#762;.'),
(20, 123, 'Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together &#761;with Satan&#762; as enemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray &#761;in this life&#762; nor suffer &#761;in the next&#762;.'),
(20, 124, 'But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life, then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment.”'),
(20, 125, 'They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?”'),
(20, 126, 'Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.”'),
(20, 127, 'This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting.'),
(20, 128, 'Is it not yet clear to them how many peoples We destroyed before them, whose ruins they still pass by? Surely in this are signs for people of sound judgment.'),
(20, 129, 'Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord &#761;O Prophet&#762; and a term already set, their &#761;instant&#762; doom would have been inevitable.'),
(20, 130, 'So be patient &#761;O Prophet&#762; with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him in the hours of the night and at both ends of the day, so that you may be pleased &#761;with the reward&#762;.'),
(20, 131, 'Do not let your eyes crave what We have allowed some of the disbelievers to enjoy; the &#761;fleeting&#762; splendour of this worldly life, which We test them with. But your Lord’s provision &#761;in the Hereafter&#762; is far better and more lasting.'),
(20, 132, 'Bid your people to pray, and be diligent in &#761;observing&#762; it. We do not ask you to provide. It is We Who provide for you. And the ultimate outcome is &#761;only&#762; for &#761;the people of&#762; righteousness.'),
(20, 133, 'They demand, “If only he could bring us a sign from his Lord!” Have they not &#761;already&#762; received a confirmation of what is in earlier Scriptures?'),
(20, 134, 'Had We destroyed them with a torment before this &#761;Prophet came&#762;, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and put to shame.”'),
(20, 135, 'Say &#761;to them, O Prophet&#762;, “Each &#761;of us&#762; is waiting, so keep waiting! You will soon know who is on the Straight Path and is &#761;rightly&#762; guided.”'),

(21, 2, 'Whatever new reminder comes to them from their Lord, they only listen to it jokingly,'),
(21, 3, 'with their hearts &#761;totally&#762; distracted. The evildoers would converse secretly, &#761;saying,&#762; “Is this &#761;one&#762; not human like yourselves? Would you fall for &#761;this&#762; witchcraft, even though you can &#761;clearly&#762; see?”'),

(21, 85, 'And &#761;remember&#762; Ishmael, Enoch, and &#11371;ul-Kifl. They were all steadfast.'),
(21, 86, 'We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were truly of the righteous.'),
(21, 87, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when the Man of the Whale stormed off &#761;from his city&#762; in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him. Then in the &#761;veils of&#762; darkness he cried out, “There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.”'),
(21, 88, 'So We answered his prayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(21, 89, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Zachariah cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Do not leave me childless, though You are the Best of Successors.”'),
(21, 90, 'So We answered his prayer, granted him John, and made his wife fertile. Indeed, they used to race in doing good, and call upon Us with hope and fear, totally humbling themselves before Us.'),
(21, 91, 'And &#761;remember&#762; the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, &#761;Gabriel,&#762; making her and her son a sign for all peoples.'),
(21, 92, '&#761;O prophets!&#762; Indeed, this religion of yours is &#761;only&#762; one, and I am your Lord, so worship Me &#761;alone&#762;.'),
(21, 93, 'Yet the people have divided it into sects. But to Us they will all return.'),
(21, 94, 'So whoever does good and is a believer will never be denied &#761;the reward for&#762; their striving, for We are recording it all.'),
(21, 95, 'It is impossible for a society which We have destroyed to ever rise again,'),
(21, 96, 'until &#761;after&#762; Gog and Magog have broken loose &#761;from the barrier&#762;, swarming down from every hill,'),
(21, 97, 'ushering in the True Promise. Then—behold!—the disbelievers will stare &#761;in horror, crying,&#762; “Oh, woe to us! We have truly been heedless of this. In fact, we have been wrongdoers.”'),
(21, 98, 'Certainly you &#761;disbelievers&#762; and whatever you worship instead of Allah will be the fuel of Hell. You are &#761;all&#762; bound to enter it.'),
(21, 99, 'Had those idols been &#761;true&#762; gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be there forever.'),
(21, 100, 'In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear.'),
(21, 101, 'Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept far away from Hell,'),
(21, 102, 'not even hearing the slightest hissing from it. And they will delight forever in what their souls desire.'),
(21, 103, 'The Supreme Horror &#761;of that Day&#762; will not disturb them, and the angels will greet them, &#761;saying,&#762; “This is your Day, which you have been promised.”'),
(21, 104, 'On that Day We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We produced the first creation, &#761;so&#762; shall We reproduce it. That is a promise binding on Us. We truly uphold &#761;Our promises&#762;!'),
(21, 105, 'Surely, following the &#761;heavenly&#762; Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”'),
(21, 106, 'Surely this &#761;Quran&#762; is sufficient &#761;as a reminder&#762; for those devoted to worship.'),
(21, 107, 'We have sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; only as a mercy for the whole world.'),
(21, 108, 'Say, “What has been revealed to me is this: ‘Your God is only One God.’ Will you then submit?”'),
(21, 109, 'If they turn away, then say, “I have warned you all equally. I do not know if what you are threatened with is near or far.'),
(21, 110, 'Allah surely knows what you say openly and whatever you hide.'),
(21, 111, 'I do not know if this &#761;delay&#762; is possibly a test for you and an enjoyment for a while.”'),
(21, 112, '&#761;In the end,&#762; the Prophet said, “My Lord! Judge &#761;between us&#762; in truth. And our Lord is the Most Compassionate, Whose help is sought against what you claim.”'),
(22, 1, 'O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the &#761;violent&#762; quaking at the Hour is surely a dreadful thing.'),
(22, 2, 'The Day you see it, every nursing mother will abandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden &#761;prematurely&#762;. And you will see people &#761;as if they were&#762; drunk, though they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is &#761;terribly&#762; severe.'),
(22, 3, '&#761;Still&#762; there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, and follow every rebellious devil.'),
(22, 4, 'It has been decreed for such devils that whoever takes them as a guide will be misguided and led by them into the torment of the Blaze.'),
(22, 5, 'O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then &#761;know that&#762; We did create you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then &#761;developed you into&#762; a clinging clot &#761;of blood&#762;, then a lump of flesh—fully formed or unformed—in order to demonstrate &#761;Our power&#762; to you. &#761;Then&#762; We settle whatever &#761;embryo&#762; We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you &#761;may&#762; die &#761;young&#762;, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir &#761;to life&#762; and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant.'),
(22, 6, 'That is because Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Truth, He &#761;alone&#762; gives life to the dead, and He &#761;alone&#762; is Most Capable of everything.'),
(22, 7, 'And certainly the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it. And Allah will surely resurrect those in the graves.'),
(22, 8, '&#761;Still&#762; there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, guidance, or an enlightening scripture,'),
(22, 9, 'turning away &#761;in pride&#762; to lead &#761;others&#762; astray from Allah’s Way. They will suffer disgrace in this world, and on the Day of Judgment We will make them taste the torment of burning.'),
(22, 10, '&#761;They will be told,&#762; “This is &#761;the reward&#762; for what your hands have done. And Allah is never unjust to &#761;His&#762; servants.”'),
(22, 11, 'And there are some who worship Allah on the verge &#761;of faith&#762;: if they are blessed with something good, they are content with it; but if they are afflicted with a trial, they relapse &#761;into disbelief&#762;, losing this world and the Hereafter. That is &#761;truly&#762; the clearest loss.'),
(22, 12, 'They call besides Allah what can neither harm nor benefit them. That is &#761;truly&#762; the farthest one can stray.'),
(22, 13, 'They invoke those whose worship leads to harm, not benefit. What an evil patron and what an evil associate!'),
(22, 14, 'Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens, under which rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wills.'),
(22, 15, 'Whoever thinks that Allah will not help His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle themselves, then let them see if this plan will do away with &#761;the cause of&#762; their rage.'),
(22, 16, 'And so We revealed this &#761;Quran&#762; as clear verses. And Allah certainly guides whoever He wills.'),
(22, 17, 'Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians, Christians, Magi, and the polytheists—Allah will judge between them &#761;all&#762; on Judgment Day. Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.'),
(22, 18, 'Do you not see that to Allah bow down &#761;in submission&#762; all those in the heavens and all those on the earth, as well as the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and &#761;all&#762; living beings, as well as many humans, while many are deserving of punishment. And whoever Allah disgraces, none can honour. Surely Allah does what He wills.'),
(22, 19, 'These are two opposing groups that disagree about their Lord: as for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for them and boiling water will be poured over their heads,'),
(22, 20, 'melting whatever is in their bellies, along with their skin.'),
(22, 21, 'And awaiting them are maces of iron.'),
(22, 22, 'Whenever they try to escape from Hell—out of anguish—they will be forced back into it, &#761;and will be told,&#762; “Taste the torment of burning!”'),
(22, 23, '&#761;But&#762; Allah will surely admit those who believe and do good into Gardens, under which rivers flow, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk,'),
(22, 24, 'for they have been guided to the best of speech, and they have been guided to the Commendable Path.'),
(22, 25, 'Indeed, those who persist in disbelief and hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah and from the Sacred Mosque—which We have appointed for all people, residents and visitors alike—along with whoever intends to deviate by doing wrong in it, We will cause them to taste a painful punishment.'),
(22, 26, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House, &#761;saying,&#762; “Do not associate anything with Me &#761;in worship&#762; and purify My House for those who circle &#761;the Ka’bah&#762;, stand &#761;in prayer&#762;, and bow and prostrate themselves.'),
(22, 27, 'Call &#761;all&#762; people to the pilgrimage. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant path,'),
(22, 28, 'so they may obtain the benefits &#761;in store&#762; for them, and pronounce the Name of Allah on appointed days over the sacrificial animals He has provided for them. So eat from their meat and feed the desperately poor.'),
(22, 29, 'Then let them groom themselves, fulfil their vows, and circle the Ancient House.”'),
(22, 30, 'That is so. And whoever honours the rituals of Allah, it is best for them in the sight of their Lord. The &#761;meat of&#762; cattle has been made lawful for you, except what has &#761;already&#762; been recited to you. So shun the impurity of idolatry, and shun words of falsehood.'),
(22, 31, 'Be upright &#761;in devotion&#762; to Allah, associating none with Him &#761;in worship&#762;. For whoever associates &#761;others&#762; with Allah is like someone who has fallen from the sky and is either snatched away by birds or swept by the wind to a remote place.'),
(22, 32, 'That is so. And whoever honours the symbols of Allah, it is certainly out of the piety of the heart.'),
(22, 33, 'You may benefit from sacrificial animals for an appointed term, then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House.'),
(22, 34, 'For every community We appointed a rite of sacrifice so that they may pronounce the Name of Allah over the sacrificial animals He has provided for them. For your God is only One God, so submit yourselves to Him &#761;alone&#762;. And give good news &#761;O Prophet&#762; to the humble:'),
(22, 35, 'those whose hearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, who patiently endure whatever may befall them, and who establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them.'),
(22, 36, 'We have made sacrificial camels &#761;and cattle&#762; among the symbols of Allah, in which there is &#761;much&#762; good for you. So pronounce the Name of Allah over them when they are lined up &#761;for sacrifice&#762;. Once they have fallen &#761;lifeless&#762; on their sides, you may eat from their meat, and feed the needy—those who do not beg, and those who do. In this way We have subjected these &#761;animals&#762; to you so that you may be grateful.'),
(22, 37, 'Neither their meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news to the good-doers.'),
(22, 38, 'Indeed, Allah defends those who believe. Surely Allah does not like whoever is deceitful, ungrateful.'),
(22, 39, 'Permission &#761;to fight back&#762; is &#761;hereby&#762; granted to those being fought, for they have been wronged. And Allah is truly Most Capable of helping them &#761;prevail&#762;.'),
(22, 40, '&#761;They are&#762; those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled &#761;the aggression of&#762; some people by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty.'),
(22, 41, '&#761;They are&#762; those who, if established in the land by Us, would perform prayer, pay alms-tax, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil. And with Allah rests the outcome of all affairs.'),
(22, 42, 'If they deny you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, so did the people of Noah before them, as well as &#761;the tribes of&#762; ’&#514;d and Thamûd,'),
(22, 43, 'the people of Abraham, the people of Lot,'),
(22, 44, 'and the residents of Midian. And Moses was denied &#761;too&#762;. But I delayed &#761;the fate of&#762; the disbelievers &#761;until their appointed time&#762; then seized them. And how severe was My response!'),
(22, 45, 'Many are the societies We have destroyed for persisting in wrongdoing, leaving them in total ruin. &#761;Many are&#762; also the abandoned wells and lofty palaces!'),
(22, 46, 'Have they not travelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may listen? Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind.'),
(22, 47, 'They challenge you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to hasten the torment. And Allah will never fail in His promise. But a day with your Lord is indeed like a thousand years by your counting.'),
(22, 48, 'Many are the societies whose end We delayed while they did wrong, then seized them. And to Me is the final return.'),
(22, 49, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O humanity! I am only sent to you with a clear warning.'),
(22, 50, 'So those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.'),
(22, 51, 'But those who strive to discredit Our revelations, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.”'),
(22, 52, 'Whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; and he recited &#761;Our revelations&#762;, Satan would influence &#761;people’s understanding of&#762; his recitation. But &#761;eventually&#762; Allah would eliminate Satan’s influence. Then Allah would &#761;firmly&#762; establish His revelations. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(22, 53, 'All that so He may make Satan’s influence a trial for those &#761;hypocrites&#762; whose hearts are sick and those &#761;disbelievers&#762; whose hearts are hardened. Surely the wrongdoers are totally engrossed in opposition.'),
(22, 54, '&#761;This is&#762; also so that those gifted with knowledge would know that this &#761;revelation&#762; is the truth from your Lord, so they have faith in it, and so their hearts would submit humbly to it. And Allah surely guides the believers to the Straight Path.'),
(22, 55, 'Yet the disbelievers will persist in doubt about this &#761;revelation&#762; until the Hour takes them by surprise, or the torment of a terminating Day comes to them.'),
(22, 56, 'All authority on that Day is for Allah &#761;alone&#762;. He will judge between them. So those who believe and do good will be in the Gardens of Bliss.'),
(22, 57, 'But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, it is they who will suffer a humiliating punishment.'),
(22, 58, 'As for those who emigrate in the cause of Allah and then are martyred or die, Allah will indeed grant them a good provision. Surely Allah is the Best Provider.'),
(22, 59, 'He will certainly admit them into a place they will be pleased with. For Allah is truly All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.'),
(22, 60, 'That is so. And whoever retaliates in equivalence to the injury they have received, and then are wronged &#761;again&#762;, Allah will certainly help them. Surely Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.'),
(22, 61, 'That is because Allah causes the night to merge into the day, and the day into the night. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.'),
(22, 62, 'That is because Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and Allah &#761;alone&#762; is truly the Most High, All-Great.'),
(22, 63, 'Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, then the earth becomes green? Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.'),
(22, 64, 'To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Allah &#761;alone&#762; is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(22, 65, 'Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the earth as well as the ships &#761;that&#762; sail through the sea by His command? He keeps the sky from falling down on the earth except by His permission. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.'),
(22, 66, 'And He is the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. &#761;But&#762; surely humankind is ever ungrateful.'),
(22, 67, 'For every community We appointed a code of life to follow. So do not let them dispute with you &#761;O Prophet&#762; in this matter. And invite &#761;all&#762; to your Lord, for you are truly on the Right Guidance.'),
(22, 68, 'But if they argue with you, then say, “Allah knows best what you do.”'),
(22, 69, 'Allah will judge between you &#761;all&#762; on Judgment Day regarding your differences.'),
(22, 70, 'Do you not know that Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? Surely it is all &#761;written&#762; in a Record. That is certainly easy for Allah.'),
(22, 71, 'Yet they worship besides Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge. The wrongdoers will have no helper.'),
(22, 72, 'Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, you &#761;O Prophet&#762; recognize rage on the faces of the disbelievers, as if they are going to snap at those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, “Shall I inform you of something far more enraging than that? &#761;It is&#762; the Fire with which Allah has threatened those who disbelieve. What an evil destination!”'),
(22, 73, 'O humanity! A lesson is set forth, so listen to it &#761;carefully&#762;: those &#761;idols&#762; you invoke besides Allah can never create &#761;so much as&#762; a fly, even if they &#761;all&#762; were to come together for that. And if a fly were to snatch anything away from them, they cannot &#761;even&#762; retrieve it from the fly. How powerless are those who invoke and those invoked!'),
(22, 74, 'They have not shown Allah the reverence He deserves. Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.'),
(22, 75, 'Allah selects messengers from both angels and people, for Allah is truly All-Hearing, All-Seeing.'),
(22, 76, 'He knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them. And to Allah &#761;all&#762; matters will be returned &#761;for judgment&#762;.'),
(22, 77, 'O believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord, and do &#761;what is&#762; good so that you may be successful.'),
(22, 78, 'Strive for &#761;the cause of&#762; Allah in the way He deserves, for &#761;it is&#762; He &#761;Who&#762; has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham. &#761;It is Allah&#762; Who named you ‘the ones who submit’ &#761;in the&#762; earlier &#761;Scriptures&#762; and in this &#761;Quran&#762;, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to Allah. He &#761;alone&#762; is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper!'),
(23, 1, 'Successful indeed are the believers:'),
(23, 2, 'those who humble themselves in prayer;'),
(23, 3, 'those who avoid idle talk;'),
(23, 4, 'those who pay alms-tax;'),
(23, 5, 'those who guard their chastity'),
(23, 6, 'except with their wives or those &#761;bondwomen&#762; in their possession, for then they are free from blame,'),
(23, 7, 'but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors;'),
(23, 8, '&#761;the believers are also&#762; those who are true to their trusts and covenants;'),
(23, 9, 'and those who are &#761;properly&#762; observant of their prayers.'),
(23, 10, 'These are the ones who will be awarded'),
(23, 11, 'Paradise as their own. They will be there forever.'),
(23, 12, 'And indeed, We created humankind from an extract of clay,'),
(23, 13, 'then placed each &#761;human&#762; as a sperm-drop in a secure place,'),
(23, 14, 'then We developed the drop into a clinging clot &#761;of blood&#762;, then developed the clot into a lump &#761;of flesh&#762;, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.'),
(23, 15, 'After that you will surely die,'),
(23, 16, 'then on the Day of Judgment you will be resurrected.'),
(23, 17, 'And indeed, We created above you seven levels &#761;of heaven&#762;. We are never unmindful of &#761;Our&#762; creation.'),
(23, 18, 'We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away.'),
(23, 19, 'With it We produce for you gardens of palm trees and grapevines, in which there are abundant fruits, and from which you may eat,'),
(23, 20, 'as well as &#761;olive&#762; trees which grow at Mount Sinai, providing oil and a condiment to eat.'),
(23, 21, 'And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle, from whose bellies We give you &#761;milk&#762; to drink, and in them are many other benefits for you, and from them you may eat.'),
(23, 22, 'And you are carried upon &#761;some of&#762; them and upon ships.'),
(23, 23, 'Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He declared, “O my people! Worship Allah &#761;alone&#762;. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear &#761;Him&#762;?”'),
(23, 24, 'But the disbelieving chiefs of his people said &#761;to the masses&#762;, “This is only a human like you, who wants to be superior to you. Had Allah willed, He could have easily sent down angels &#761;instead&#762;. We have never heard of this in &#761;the history of&#762; our forefathers.'),
(23, 25, 'He is simply insane, so bear with him for a while.”'),
(23, 26, 'Noah prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied &#761;me&#762;.”'),
(23, 27, 'So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under Our &#761;watchful&#762; Eyes and directions. Then when Our command comes and the oven bursts &#761;with water&#762;, take on board a pair from every species along with your family—except those against whom the decree &#761;to drown&#762; has already been passed. And do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”'),
(23, 28, 'Then when you and those with you have settled in the Ark, say, “All praise is for Allah, Who saved us from the wrongdoing people.”'),
(23, 29, 'And pray, “My Lord! Allow me a blessed landing, for You are the best accommodator.”'),
(23, 30, 'Surely in this are lessons. And We &#761;always&#762; put &#761;people&#762; to the test.'),
(23, 31, 'Then We raised another generation after them,'),
(23, 32, 'and sent to them a messenger from among themselves, &#761;declaring,&#762; “Worship Allah &#761;alone&#762;. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear &#761;Him&#762;?”'),
(23, 33, 'But the chiefs of his people—who disbelieved, denied the meeting &#761;with Allah&#762; in the Hereafter, and were spoiled by the worldly luxuries We had provided for them—said &#761;to the masses&#762;, “This is only a human like you. He eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink.'),
(23, 34, 'And if you &#761;ever&#762; obey a human like yourselves, then you would certainly be losers.'),
(23, 35, 'Does he promise you that once you are dead and reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth &#761;alive&#762;?'),
(23, 36, 'Impossible, simply impossible is what you are promised!'),
(23, 37, 'There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die, others are born, and none will be resurrected.'),

(23, 39, 'The messenger prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied &#761;me&#762;.”'),
(23, 40, 'Allah responded, “Soon they will be truly regretful.”'),

(24, 14, 'Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and the Hereafter, you would have certainly been touched with a tremendous punishment for what you plunged into—'),

Let them not stomp their feet, drawing attention to their hidden adornments. Turn to Allah in repentance all together, O believers, so that you may be successful.'),

And if any of those &#761;bondspeople&#762; in your possession desires a deed of emancipation, make it possible for them, if you find goodness in them. And give them some of Allah’s wealth which He has granted you. Do not force your &#761;slave&#762; girls into prostitution for your own worldly gains while they wish to remain chaste. And if someone coerces them, then after such a coercion Allah is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful &#761;to them&#762;.'),

Light upon light! Allah guides whoever He wills to His light. And Allah sets forth parables for humanity. For Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(24, 36, '&#761;That light shines&#762; through houses &#761;of worship&#762; which Allah has ordered to be raised, and where His Name is mentioned. He is glorified there morning and evening'),

(24, 40, 'Or &#761;their deeds are&#762; like the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves upon waves, topped by &#761;dark&#762; clouds. Darkness upon darkness! If one stretches out their hand, they can hardly see it. And whoever Allah does not bless with light will have no light!'),

The flash of the clouds’ lightning nearly takes away eyesight.'),
(24, 44, 'Allah alternates the day and night. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.'),

Other than these times, there is no blame on you or them to move freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(24, 59, 'And when your children reach the age of puberty, let them seek permission &#761;to come in&#762;, as their seniors do. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(24, 60, 'As for elderly women past the age of marriage, there is no blame on them if they take off their &#761;outer&#762; garments, without revealing their adornments. But it is better for them if they avoid this &#761;altogether&#762;. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),

There is no blame on you eating together or separately. However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting &#761;of peace&#762; from Allah, blessed and good.

(24, 62, 'The &#761;true&#762; believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission &#761;O Prophet&#762; are the ones who &#761;truly&#762; believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to whoever you wish and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(24, 63, 'Do not treat the Messenger’s summons to you &#761;as lightly&#762; as your summons to one another. Allah certainly knows those of you who slip away, hiding behind others.

(27, 34, 'She reasoned, “Indeed, when kings invade a land, they ruin it and debase its nobles. They really do so!'),

(27, 36, 'When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me wealth? What Allah has granted me is far greater than what He has granted you. No! It is you who rejoice in &#761;receiving&#762; gifts.'),

(27, 38, 'Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in &#761;full&#762; submission?”'),
(27, 39, 'One mighty jinn responded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours. And I am quite strong and trustworthy for this &#761;task&#762;.”'),
(27, 40, 'But the one who had knowledge of the Scripture said, “I can bring it to you in the blink of an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, “This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But whoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”'),
(27, 41, '&#761;Then&#762; Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see whether she will recognize &#761;it&#762; or she will not be able to.”'),
(27, 42, 'So when she arrived, it was said &#761;to her&#762;, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks to be the same. We have &#761;already&#762; received knowledge &#761;of Solomon’s prophethood&#762; before this &#761;miracle&#762;, and have submitted &#761;to Allah&#762;.”'),
(27, 43, 'But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of Allah, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people.'),
(27, 44, 'Then she was told, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw the hall, she thought it was a body of water, so she bared her legs. Solomon said. “It is just a palace paved with crystal.” &#761;At last&#762; she declared, “My Lord! I have certainly wronged my soul. Now I &#761;fully&#762; submit myself along with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of all worlds.”'),
(27, 45, 'And We certainly sent to the people of Thamûd their brother &#7778;âli&#7717;, proclaiming, “Worship Allah,” but they suddenly split into two opposing groups.'),
(27, 46, 'He urged &#761;the disbelieving group&#762;, “O my people! Why do you &#761;seek to&#762; hasten the torment rather than grace? If only you sought Allah’s forgiveness so you may be shown mercy!”'),
(27, 47, 'They replied, “You and your followers are a bad omen for us.” He responded, “Your omens are destined by Allah. In fact, you are &#761;only&#762; a people being tested.”'),
(27, 48, 'And there were in the city nine &#761;elite&#762; men who spread corruption in the land, never doing what is right.'),

(27, 50, 'And &#761;so&#762; they made a plan, but We too made a plan, while they were unaware.'),
(27, 51, 'See then what the consequences of their plan were: We &#761;utterly&#762; destroyed them and their people all together.'),

The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.”'),
(28, 16, 'He pleaded, “My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He forgave him, &#761;for&#762; He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(28, 17, 'Moses pledged, “My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with the wicked.”'),
(28, 18, 'And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses rebuked him, “Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.”'),
(28, 19, 'Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe, the enemy said, “O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!”'),
(28, 20, 'And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to death, so leave &#761;the city&#762;. I really advise you &#761;to do so&#762;.”'),
(28, 21, 'So Moses left the city in a state of fear and caution, praying, “My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people.”'),
(28, 22, 'And as he made his way towards Midian, he said, “I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.”'),
(28, 23, 'When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people watering &#761;their herds&#762;. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding back &#761;their herd&#762;. He asked &#761;them&#762;, “What is the problem?” They replied, “We cannot water &#761;our animals&#762; until the &#761;other&#762; shepherds are done, for our father is a very old man.”'),
(28, 24, 'So he watered &#761;their herd&#762; for them, then withdrew to the shade and prayed, “My Lord! I am truly in &#761;desperate&#762; need of whatever provision You may have in store for me.”'),
(28, 25, 'Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering &#761;our animals&#762; for us.” When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man said, “Have no fear! You are &#761;now&#762; safe from the wrongdoing people.”'),
(28, 26, 'One of the two daughters suggested, “O my dear father! Hire him. The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy &#761;one&#762;.”'),
(28, 27, 'The old man proposed, “I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete ten, it will be &#761;a favour&#762; from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for you. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.”'),
(28, 28, 'Moses responded, “&#761;Then&#762; it is &#761;settled&#762; between you and I. Whichever term I fulfill, there will be no &#761;further&#762; obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to what we say.”'),
(28, 29, 'When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount &#7788;ûr. He said to his family, “Stay here, &#761;for&#762; I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.”'),
(28, 30, 'But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Lord of all worlds.'),
(28, 31, 'Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. &#761;Allah reassured him,&#762; “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.'),
(28, 32, 'Now put your hand through &#761;the opening of&#762; your collar, it will come out &#761;shining&#762; white, unblemished. And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.”'),
(28, 33, 'Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me.'),
(28, 34, 'And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.”'),
(28, 35, 'Allah responded, “We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will &#761;certainly&#762; prevail.”'),
(28, 36, 'But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said &#761;arrogantly&#762;, “This is nothing but conjured magic &#761;tricks&#762;. We have never heard of this in &#761;the history of&#762; our forefathers.”'),
(28, 37, 'Moses responded, “My Lord knows best who has come with &#761;true&#762; guidance from Him and will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”'),
(28, 38, 'Pharaoh declared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”'),
(28, 39, 'And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right, thinking they would never be returned to Us.'),
(28, 40, 'So We seized him and his soldiers, casting them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!'),
(28, 41, 'We made them leaders inviting &#761;others&#762; to the Fire. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped.'),
(28, 42, 'We caused a curse to follow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among the outcasts.'),
(28, 43, 'Indeed, We gave Moses the Scripture—after destroying earlier nations—as an insight for the people, a guide, and mercy so perhaps they would be mindful.'),
(28, 44, 'You were not there &#761;O Prophet&#762; on the western side of the mountain when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present &#761;in his time&#762;.'),
(28, 45, 'But We &#761;later&#762; raised &#761;several&#762; generations, and the ages took their toll on them. Nor were you living among the people of Midian, rehearsing Our revelations with them. But it is We Who have sent &#761;this revelation to you&#762;.'),
(28, 46, 'And you were not at the side of Mount &#7788;ûr when We called out &#761;to Moses&#762;. But &#761;you have been sent&#762; as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so perhaps they may be mindful.'),
(28, 47, 'Also so they would not say, if struck by an affliction for what their hands have done: “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations and become believers.”'),
(28, 48, 'But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what Moses had been given.” Did they not deny what had been given to Moses earlier? They claimed, “Both &#761;Scriptures&#762; are works of magic, supporting each other!” Adding, “We truly deny both.”'),
(28, 49, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Bring then a scripture from Allah which is a better guide than these two so I may follow it, if your claim is true.”'),
(28, 50, 'So if they fail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'),
(28, 51, 'Indeed, We have steadily delivered the Word &#761;of Allah&#762; to the people so they may be mindful.'),
(28, 52, '&#761;As for&#762; those &#761;faithful&#762; to whom We had given the Scripture before this &#761;Quran&#762;, they do believe in it.'),
(28, 53, 'When it is recited to them, they declare, “We believe in it. This is definitely the truth from our Lord. We had already submitted &#761;even&#762; before this.”'),
(28, 54, 'These &#761;believers&#762; will be given a double reward for their perseverance, responding to evil with good, and for donating from what We have provided for them.'),
(28, 55, 'When they hear slanderous talk, they turn away from it, saying, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace &#761;is our only response&#762; to you! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.”'),
(28, 56, 'You surely cannot guide whoever you like &#761;O Prophet&#762;, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are &#761;fit to be&#762; guided.'),
(28, 57, 'They say &#761;to the Prophet&#762;, “If we were to follow &#761;true&#762; guidance with you, we would certainly be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established for them a safe haven &#761;in Mecca&#762; to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know &#761;this favour&#762;.'),
(28, 58, '&#761;Imagine&#762; how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their &#761;comfortable&#762; living! Those are their residences, never inhabited after them except passingly. And We &#761;alone&#762; were the Successor.'),
(28, 59, 'Your Lord would never destroy a society until He had sent to its capital a messenger, reciting Our revelations to them. Nor would We ever destroy a society unless its people persisted in wrongdoing.'),
(28, 60, 'Whatever &#761;pleasure&#762; you have been given is no more than &#761;a fleeting&#762; enjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting. Will you not then understand?'),
(28, 61, 'Can those to whom We have made a fine promise—which they will see fulfilled—be like those who We have allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this worldly life, but on the Day of Judgment will be brought &#761;for punishment&#762;?'),
(28, 62, '&#761;Watch for&#762; the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”'),
(28, 63, 'Those &#761;misleaders&#762; against whom the decree &#761;of torment&#762; is justified will cry, “Our Lord! These &#761;followers&#762; are the ones we caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were deviant. We disassociate ourselves &#761;from them&#762; before You. It was not us that they used to worship.”'),
(28, 64, 'It will be said &#761;to the disbelievers&#762;, “Call upon your associate-gods &#761;for help&#762;.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had been &#761;rightly&#762; guided!'),
(28, 65, 'And &#761;watch for&#762; the Day He will call to them, asking, “What response did you give to the messengers?”'),
(28, 66, 'They will be too dumbstruck on that Day to ask one another &#761;for answers&#762;.'),
(28, 67, 'As for those who repent, believe, and do good &#761;in this world&#762;, it is right to hope that they will be among the successful.'),
(28, 68, 'Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills—the choice is not theirs. Glorified and Exalted is Allah above what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;!'),
(28, 69, 'And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.'),
(28, 70, 'He is Allah. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.'),
(28, 71, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Imagine if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?”'),
(28, 72, 'Ask &#761;them also&#762;, “Imagine if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Will you not then see?”'),
(28, 73, 'It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the day and night so that you may rest &#761;in the latter&#762; and seek His bounty &#761;in the former&#762;, and perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(28, 74, 'And &#761;watch for&#762; the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”'),
(28, 75, 'And We will bring forth a witness from every faith-community and ask &#761;the polytheists&#762;, “Show &#761;Us&#762; your proof.” Then they will &#761;come to&#762; know that the truth is with Allah &#761;alone&#762;. And whatever &#761;gods&#762; they fabricated will fail them.'),
(28, 76, 'Indeed, Korah was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. &#761;Some of&#762; his people advised him, “Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful.'),
(28, 77, 'Rather, seek the &#761;reward&#762; of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good &#761;to others&#762; as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.”'),
(28, 78, 'He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.” Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating &#761;wealth&#762;? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins.'),
(28, 79, 'Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!”'),
(28, 80, 'But those gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.”'),
(28, 81, 'Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself.'),
(28, 82, 'And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, “Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.”'),
(28, 83, 'That &#761;eternal&#762; Home in the Hereafter We reserve &#761;only&#762; for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs &#761;only&#762; to the righteous.'),
(28, 84, 'Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better. And whoever comes with an evil deed, then the evildoers will only be rewarded for what they used to do.'),
(28, 85, 'Most certainly, the One Who has ordained the Quran for you will &#761;ultimately&#762; bring you back home &#761;to Mecca&#762;. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with &#761;true&#762; guidance and who is clearly astray.”'),
(28, 86, 'You never expected this Book to be revealed to you, but &#761;it came&#762; only &#761;as&#762; a mercy from your Lord. So never side with the disbelievers &#761;in their disbelief&#762;.'),
(28, 87, 'Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite &#761;all&#762; to &#761;the Way of&#762; your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists.'),
(28, 88, 'And do not invoke any other god with Allah. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. Everything is bound to perish except He Himself. All authority belongs to Him. And to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.'),
(29, 1, '<i>Alif-Lãm-M&#297;m.</i>'),
(29, 2, 'Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they will be left without being put to the test?'),
(29, 3, 'We certainly tested those before them. And &#761;in this way&#762; Allah will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars.'),
(29, 4, 'Or do the evildoers &#761;simply&#762; think that they will escape Us? How wrong is their judgment!'),
(29, 5, 'Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, &#761;let them know that&#762; Allah’s appointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),

(29, 8, 'We have commanded people to honour their parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them. To Me you will &#761;all&#762; return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do.'),
(29, 9, 'Those who believe and do good will surely be admitted by Us into &#761;the company of&#762; the righteous.'),
(29, 10, 'There are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake &#761;this&#762; persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say &#761;to the believers&#762;, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings?'),
(29, 11, 'Allah will certainly distinguish between those who have &#761;sure&#762; faith and the hypocrites.'),
(29, 12, 'The disbelievers say to the believers, “&#761;Just&#762; follow our way, and we will bear &#761;the burden of&#762; your sins.” But they would never &#761;want to&#762; bear any of the believers’ sins. They are simply lying.'),
(29, 13, 'Yet they will certainly &#761;be made to&#762; carry their own burdens, as well as other burdens along with their own. And they will surely be questioned on Judgment Day about what they used to fabricate.'),
(29, 14, 'Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them for a thousand years, less fifty. Then the Flood overtook them, while they persisted in wrongdoing.'),
(29, 15, 'But We delivered him and those in the Ark, making it a sign for all people.'),
(29, 16, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham said to his people, “Worship Allah, and fear Him. This is better for you, if only you knew.'),
(29, 17, 'You worship besides Allah nothing but idols, simply creating lies &#761;about them&#762;. Those you worship besides Allah certainly cannot give you any provision. So seek provision from Allah &#761;alone&#762;, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.”'),
(29, 18, 'If you &#761;Meccans&#762; persist in denial, so did &#761;many&#762; communities before you. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly.'),
(29, 19, 'Have they not seen how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah.'),
(29, 20, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Travel throughout the land and see how He originated the creation, then Allah will bring it into being one more time. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(29, 21, 'He punishes whoever He wills, and shows mercy to whoever He wills. And you will &#761;all&#762; be returned to Him.'),
(29, 22, 'And you cannot escape Him on earth or in heaven. Nor have you any protector or helper besides Allah.”'),
(29, 23, 'As for those who disbelieve in Allah’s signs and the meeting with Him, it is they who will have no hope in His mercy. And it is they who will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(29, 24, 'But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire. Surely in this are signs for people who believe.'),
(29, 25, 'He said &#761;to his people&#762;, “You have taken idols &#761;for worship&#762; instead of Allah, only to keep &#761;the bond of&#762; harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!”'),
(29, 26, 'So Lot believed in him. And Abraham said, “I am emigrating &#761;in obedience&#762; to my Lord. He &#761;alone&#762; is indeed the Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(29, 27, 'We blessed him with Isaac and &#761;later&#762; Jacob, and reserved prophethood and revelation for his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life, and in the Hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous.'),
(29, 28, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Lot rebuked &#761;the men of&#762; his people: “You certainly commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before you.'),
(29, 29, 'Do you really lust after &#761;other&#762; men, abuse the travellers, and practice immorality &#761;openly&#762; in your gatherings?” His people’s only response was to say &#761;mockingly&#762;: “Bring Allah’s punishment upon us, if what you say is true.”'),
(29, 30, 'Lot prayed, “My Lord! Help me against the people of corruption.”'),
(29, 31, 'When Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with the good news &#761;of the birth of Isaac&#762;, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this city &#761;of Sodom&#762;, for its people have persisted in wrongdoing.”'),
(29, 32, 'He said, “But Lot is there!” They responded, “We know best who is there. We will certainly save him and his family—except his wife, who is one of the doomed.”'),
(29, 33, 'And when Our messenger-angels came to Lot, he was distressed and worried by their arrival. They reassured &#761;him&#762;, “Do not fear, nor grieve. We will surely deliver you and your family—except your wife, who is one of the doomed.'),
(29, 34, 'We are certainly bringing down a punishment from heaven upon the people of this city for their rebelliousness.”'),
(29, 35, 'And We did leave &#761;some of&#762; its ruins as a clear lesson for people of understanding.'),
(29, 36, 'And to the people of Midian &#761;We sent&#762; their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah, and hope for &#761;the reward of&#762; the Last Day. And do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”'),
(29, 37, 'But they rejected him, so an &#761;overwhelming&#762; earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.'),
(29, 38, 'And the people of ’&#514;d and Thamûd &#761;met a similar fate&#762;, which must be clear to you &#761;Meccans&#762; from their ruins. Satan made their &#761;evil&#762; deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the &#761;Right&#762; Way, although they were capable of reasoning.'),
(29, 39, '&#761;We&#762; also &#761;destroyed&#762; Korah, Pharaoh, and Hamân. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape &#761;Us&#762;.'),
(29, 40, 'So We seized each &#761;people&#762; for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones, some were overtaken by a &#761;mighty&#762; blast, some We caused the earth to swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.'),
(29, 41, 'The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a shelter. And the flimsiest of all shelters is certainly that of a spider, if only they knew.'),
(29, 42, 'Allah surely knows that whatever &#761;gods&#762; they invoke besides Him are &#761;simply&#762; nothing. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(29, 43, 'These are the parables We set forth for humanity, but none will understand them except the people of knowledge.'),
(29, 44, 'Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for the people of faith.'),
(29, 45, 'Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, &#761;genuine&#762; prayer should deter &#761;one&#762; from indecency and wickedness. The remembrance of Allah is &#761;an&#762; even greater &#761;deterrent&#762;. And Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows what you &#761;all&#762; do.'),
(29, 46, 'Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. And say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is &#761;only&#762; One. And to Him we &#761;fully&#762; submit.”'),
(29, 47, 'Similarly &#761;to earlier messengers&#762;, We have revealed to you a Book &#761;O Prophet&#762;. &#761;The faithful of&#762; those to whom We gave the Scriptures believe in it, as do some of these &#761;pagan Arabs&#762;. And none denies Our revelations except the &#761;stubborn&#762; disbelievers.'),
(29, 48, 'You &#761;O Prophet&#762; could not read any writing &#761;even&#762; before this &#761;revelation&#762;, nor could you write at all. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have been suspicious.'),
(29, 49, 'But this &#761;Quran&#762; is &#761;a set of&#762; clear revelations &#761;preserved&#762; in the hearts of those gifted with knowledge. And none denies Our revelations except the &#761;stubborn&#762; wrongdoers.'),
(29, 50, 'They say, “If only &#761;some&#762; signs had been sent down to him from his Lord!” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Signs are only with Allah. And I am only sent with a clear warning.”'),
(29, 51, 'Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book, &#761;which is&#762; recited to them. Surely in this &#761;Quran&#762; is a mercy and reminder for people who believe.'),

(30, 43, 'So be steadfast in the Upright Faith &#761;O Prophet&#762;, before the coming of a Day from Allah that cannot be averted. On that Day the people will be divided:'),
(30, 44, 'those who disbelieved will bear &#761;the burden of&#762; their own disbelief; and those who did good will have prepared for themselves &#761;eternal homes&#762;,'),
(30, 45, 'so that He may &#761;generously&#762; reward those who believe and do good, out of His grace. He truly does not like the disbelievers.'),
(30, 46, 'And one of His signs is that He sends the winds, ushering in good news &#761;of rain&#762; so that He may give you a taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.'),
(30, 47, 'Indeed, We sent before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; messengers, each to their own people, and they came to them with clear proofs. Then We inflicted punishment upon those who persisted in wickedness. For it is Our duty to help the believers.'),
(30, 48, 'It is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up &#761;vapour, forming&#762; clouds, which He then spreads out in the sky or piles up into masses as He wills, from which you see rain come forth. Then as soon as He causes it to fall on whoever He wills of His servants, they rejoice,'),
(30, 49, 'although they had utterly lost hope just before it was sent down to them.'),
(30, 50, 'See then the impact of Allah’s mercy: how He gives life to the earth after its death! Surely That &#761;same God&#762; can raise the dead. For He is Most Capable of everything.'),
(30, 51, 'Then if We send a &#761;harsh&#762; wind which they see withering &#761;their&#762; crops, they will definitely deny &#761;old favours&#762; right after.'),
(30, 52, 'So you &#761;O Prophet&#762; certainly cannot make the dead hear &#761;the truth&#762;. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away.'),
(30, 53, 'Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear &#761;the truth&#762; except those who believe in Our revelations, &#761;fully&#762; submitting &#761;to Allah&#762;.'),
(30, 54, 'It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed &#761;your&#762; weakness into strength, then developed &#761;your&#762; strength into weakness and old age. He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing, Most Capable.'),
(30, 55, 'And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did not stay &#761;in this world&#762; more than an hour. In this way they were always deluded &#761;in the world&#762;.'),
(30, 56, 'But those gifted with knowledge and faith will say &#761;to them&#762;, “You did actually stay—as destined by Allah—until the Day of Resurrection. So here is the Day of Resurrection &#761;which you denied&#762;! But you did not know &#761;it was true&#762;.”'),
(30, 57, 'So on that Day the wrongdoers’ excuses will not benefit them, nor will they be allowed to appease &#761;their Lord&#762;.'),
(30, 58, 'We have certainly set forth every &#761;kind of&#762; lesson for people in this Quran. And no matter what sign you bring to them &#761;O Prophet&#762;, the disbelievers will definitely say &#761;to the believers&#762;, “You are only a people of falsehood.”'),
(30, 59, 'This is how Allah seals the hearts of those unwilling to know &#761;the truth&#762;.'),
(30, 60, 'So be patient, for the promise of Allah certainly is true. And do not be disturbed by those who have no sure faith.'),

(31, 11, 'This is Allah’s creation. Now show Me what those &#761;gods&#762; other than Him have created. In fact, the wrongdoers are clearly astray.'),
(31, 12, 'Indeed, We blessed Luqmân with wisdom, &#761;saying&#762;, “Be grateful to Allah, for whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. And whoever is ungrateful, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”'),
(31, 13, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Luqmân said to his son, while advising him, “O my dear son! Never associate &#761;anything&#762; with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;, for associating &#761;others with Him&#762; is truly the worst of all wrongs.”'),
(31, 14, 'And We have commanded people to &#761;honour&#762; their parents. Their mothers bore them through hardship upon hardship, and their weaning takes two years. So be grateful to Me and your parents. To Me is the final return.'),
(31, 15, 'But if they pressure you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. Still keep their company in this world courteously, and follow the way of those who turn to Me &#761;in devotion&#762;. Then to Me you will &#761;all&#762; return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do.'),
(31, 16, '&#761;Luqmân added,&#762; “O my dear son! &#761;Even&#762; if a deed were the weight of a mustard seed—be it &#761;hidden&#762; in a rock or in the heavens or the earth—Allah will bring it forth. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.'),
(31, 17, '“O my dear son! Establish prayer, encourage what is good and forbid what is evil, and endure patiently whatever befalls you. Surely this is a resolve to aspire to.'),

(31, 21, 'When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “No! We &#761;only&#762; follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” &#761;Would they still do so&#762; even if Satan is inviting them to the torment of the Blaze?'),
(31, 22, 'Whoever fully submits themselves to Allah and is a good-doer, they have certainly grasped the firmest hand-hold. And with Allah rests the outcome of &#761;all&#762; affairs.'),
(31, 23, 'But whoever disbelieves, do not let their disbelief grieve you &#761;O Prophet&#762;. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of all they did. Surely Allah knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(31, 24, 'We allow them enjoyment for a little while, then &#761;in time&#762; We will force them into a harsh torment.'),

(31, 26, 'To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(31, 27, 'If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean &#761;were ink&#762;, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(31, 28, 'The creation and resurrection of you &#761;all&#762; is as simple &#761;for Him&#762; as that of a single soul. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.'),

There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but &#761;only&#762; for what you do intentionally. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(33, 6, 'The Prophet has a stronger affinity to the believers than they do themselves. And his wives are their mothers. As ordained by Allah, blood relatives are more entitled &#761;to inheritance&#762; than &#761;other&#762; believers and immigrants, unless you &#761;want to&#762; show kindness to your &#761;close&#762; associates &#761;through bequest&#762;. This is decreed in the Record.'),
(33, 7, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when We took a covenant from the prophets, as well as from you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary. We did take a solemn covenant from &#761;all of&#762; them'),
(33, 8, 'so that He may question these men of truth about their &#761;delivery of the&#762; truth. And He has prepared a painful punishment for the disbelievers.'),
(33, 9, 'O believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you when &#761;enemy&#762; forces came to &#761;besiege&#762; you &#761;in Medina&#762;, so We sent against them a &#761;bitter&#762; wind and forces you could not see. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(33, 10, '&#761;Remember&#762; when they came at you from east and west, when your eyes grew wild &#761;in horror&#762; and your hearts jumped into your throats, and you entertained &#761;conflicting&#762; thoughts about Allah.'),
(33, 11, 'Then and there the believers were put to the test, and were violently shaken.'),
(33, 12, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but delusion!”'),
(33, 13, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib! There is no point in you staying &#761;here&#762;, so retreat!” Another group of them asked the Prophet’s permission &#761;to leave&#762;, saying, “Our homes are vulnerable,” while &#761;in fact&#762; they were not vulnerable. They only wished to flee.'),
(33, 14, 'Had their city been sacked from all sides and they had been asked to abandon faith, they would have done so with little hesitation.'),
(33, 15, 'They had already pledged to Allah earlier never to turn their backs &#761;in retreat&#762;. And a pledge to Allah must be answered for.'),
(33, 16, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Fleeing will not benefit you if you &#761;try to&#762; escape a natural or violent death. &#761;If it is not your time,&#762; you will only be allowed enjoyment for a little while.”'),
(33, 17, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Who can put you out of Allah’s reach if He intends to harm you or show you mercy?” They can never find any protector or helper besides Allah.'),
(33, 18, 'Allah knows well those among you who discourage &#761;others from fighting&#762;, saying &#761;secretly&#762; to their brothers, “Stay with us,” and who themselves hardly take part in fighting.'),
(33, 19, '&#761;They are&#762; totally unwilling to assist you. When danger comes, you see them staring at you with their eyes rolling like someone in the throes of death. But once the danger is over, they slash you with razor-sharp tongues, ravenous for &#761;worldly&#762; gains. Such people have not &#761;truly&#762; believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds void. And that is easy for Allah.'),
(33, 20, 'They &#761;still&#762; think that the enemy alliance has not &#761;yet&#762; withdrawn. And if the allies were to come &#761;again&#762;, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the desert among nomadic Arabs, &#761;only&#762; asking for news about you &#761;believers&#762;. And if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the fight.'),
(33, 21, 'Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.'),
(33, 22, 'When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, “This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His Messenger has come true.” And this only increased them in faith and submission.'),
(33, 23, 'Among the believers are men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah. Some of them have fulfilled their pledge &#761;with their lives&#762;, others are waiting &#761;their turn&#762;. They have never changed &#761;their commitment&#762; in the least.'),
(33, 24, '&#761;It all happened&#762; so Allah may reward the faithful for their faithfulness, and punish the hypocrites if He wills or turn to them &#761;in mercy&#762;. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(33, 25, 'And Allah drove back the disbelievers in their rage, totally empty-handed. And Allah spared the believers from fighting. For Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.'),
(33, 26, 'And He brought down those from the People of the Book who supported the enemy alliance from their own strongholds, and cast horror into their hearts. You &#761;believers&#762; killed some, and took others captive.'),
(33, 27, 'He has also caused you to take over their lands, homes, and wealth, as well as lands you have not yet set foot on. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(33, 28, 'O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire the life of this world and its luxury, then come, I will give you a &#761;suitable&#762; compensation &#761;for divorce&#762; and let you go graciously.'),
(33, 29, 'But if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the &#761;everlasting&#762; Home of the Hereafter, then Surely Allah has prepared a great reward for those of you who do good.”'),
(33, 30, 'O wives of the Prophet! If any of you were to commit a blatant misconduct, the punishment would be doubled for her. And that is easy for Allah.'),
(33, 31, 'And whoever of you devoutly obeys Allah and His Messenger and does good, We will grant her double the reward, and We have prepared for her an honourable provision.'),
(33, 32, 'O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women: if you are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, then do not be overly effeminate in speech &#761;with men&#762; or those with sickness in their hearts may be tempted, but speak in a moderate tone.'),
(33, 33, 'Settle in your homes, and do not display yourselves as women did in the days of &#761;pre-Islamic&#762; ignorance. Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only intends to keep &#761;the causes of&#762; evil away from you and purify you completely, O members of the &#761;Prophet’s&#762; family!'),
(33, 34, '&#761;Always&#762; remember what is recited in your homes of Allah’s revelations and &#761;prophetic&#762; wisdom. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.'),
(33, 35, 'Surely &#761;for&#762; Muslim men and women, believing men and women, devout men and women, truthful men and women, patient men and women, humble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and women, men and women who guard their chastity, and men and women who remember Allah often—for &#761;all of&#762; them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(33, 36, 'It is not for a believing man or woman—when Allah and His Messenger decree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter. Indeed, whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone &#761;far&#762; astray.'),
(33, 37, 'And &#761;remember, O Prophet,&#762; when you said to the one for whom Allah has done a favour and you &#761;too&#762; have done a favour, “Keep your wife and fear Allah,” while concealing within yourself what Allah was going to reveal. And &#761;so&#762; you were considering the people, whereas Allah was more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in &#761;keeping&#762; his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And Allah’s command is totally binding.'),
(33, 38, 'There is no blame on the Prophet for doing what Allah has ordained for him. That has been the way of Allah with those &#761;prophets&#762; who had gone before. And Allah’s command has been firmly decreed.'),
(33, 39, '&#761;That is His way with&#762; those &#761;prophets&#762; who deliver the messages of Allah, and consider Him, and none but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a &#761;vigilant&#762; Reckoner.'),
(33, 40, 'Mu&#7717;ammad is not the father of any of your men, but is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(33, 41, 'O believers! Always remember Allah often,'),
(33, 42, 'and glorify Him morning and evening.'),
(33, 43, 'He is the One Who showers His blessings upon you—and His angels pray for you—so that He may bring you out of darkness and into light. For He is ever Merciful to the believers.'),
(33, 44, 'Their greeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace!” And He has prepared for them an honourable reward.'),
(33, 45, 'O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and a deliverer of good news, and a warner,'),
(33, 46, 'and a caller to &#761;the Way of&#762; Allah by His command, and a beacon of light.'),
(33, 47, 'Give good news to the believers that they will have a great bounty from Allah.'),
(33, 48, 'Do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Overlook their annoyances, and put your trust in Allah. For Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.'),
(33, 49, 'O believers! If you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, they will have no waiting period for you to count, so give them a &#761;suitable&#762; compensation, and let them go graciously.'),
(33, 50, 'O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their &#761;full&#762; dowries as well as those &#761;bondwomen&#762; in your possession, whom Allah has granted you. And &#761;you are allowed to marry&#762; the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated like you. Also &#761;allowed for marriage is&#762; a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet &#761;without dowry&#762; if he is interested in marrying her—&#761;this is&#762; exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers. We know well what &#761;rulings&#762; We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those &#761;bondwomen&#762; in their possession. As such, there would be no blame on you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(33, 51, 'It is up to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to delay or receive whoever you please of your wives. There is no blame on you if you call back any of those you have set aside. That is more likely that they will be content, not grieved, and satisfied with what you offer them all. Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.'),
(33, 52, 'It is not lawful for you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to marry more women after this, nor can you replace any of your present wives with another, even if her beauty may attract you—except those &#761;bondwomen&#762; in your possession. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.'),
(33, 53, 'O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission &#761;and if invited&#762; for a meal, do not &#761;come too early and&#762; linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter &#761;on time&#762;. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you &#761;believers&#762; ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.'),
(33, 54, 'Whether you reveal something or conceal it, surely Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(33, 55, 'There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives &#761;if they appear unveiled&#762; before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their fellow &#761;Muslim&#762; women, and those &#761;bondspeople&#762; in their possession. And be mindful of Allah &#761;O wives of the Prophet!&#762; Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.'),
(33, 56, 'Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace.'),
(33, 57, 'Surely those who offend Allah and His Messenger are condemned by Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.'),
(33, 58, 'As for those who abuse believing men and women unjustifiably, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin.'),
(33, 59, 'O Prophet! Ask your wives, daughters, and believing women to draw their cloaks over their bodies. In this way it is more likely that they will be recognized &#761;as virtuous&#762; and not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(33, 60, 'If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and rumour-mongers in Medina do not desist, We will certainly incite you &#761;O Prophet&#762; against them, and then they will not be your neighbours there any longer.'),
(33, 61, '&#761;They deserve to be&#762; condemned. &#761;If they were to persist,&#762; they would get themselves seized and killed relentlessly wherever they are found!'),
(33, 62, 'That was Allah’s way with those &#761;hypocrites&#762; who have gone before. And you will find no change in Allah’s way.'),
(33, 63, 'People ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about the Hour. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah. You never know, perhaps the Hour is near.”'),
(33, 64, 'Surely Allah condemns the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a blazing Fire,'),
(33, 65, 'to stay there for ever and ever—never will they find any protector or helper.'),
(33, 66, 'On the Day their faces are &#761;constantly&#762; flipped in the Fire, they will cry, “Oh! If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!”'),
(33, 67, 'And they will say, “Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and elite, but they led us astray from the &#761;Right&#762; Way.'),
(33, 68, 'Our Lord! Give them double &#761;our&#762; punishment, and condemn them tremendously.”'),
(33, 69, 'O believers! Do not be like those who slandered Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said. And he was honourable in the sight of Allah.'),
(33, 70, 'O believers! Be mindful of Allah, and say what is right.'),
(33, 71, 'He will bless your deeds for you, and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, has truly achieved a great triumph.'),
(33, 72, 'Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they &#761;all&#762; declined to bear it, being fearful of it. But humanity assumed it, &#761;for&#762; they are truly wrongful &#761;to themselves&#762; and ignorant &#761;of the consequences&#762;,'),
(33, 73, 'so that Allah will punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, and Allah will turn in mercy to believing men and women. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(34, 1, 'All praise is for Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And praise be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.'),
(34, 2, 'He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes out of it, and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends into it. And He is the Most Merciful, All-Forgiving.'),
(34, 3, 'The disbelievers say, “The Hour will never come to us.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Yes—by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen—it will certainly come to you!” Not &#761;even&#762; an atom’s weight is hidden from Him in the heavens or the earth; nor anything smaller or larger than that, but is &#761;written&#762; in a perfect Record.'),
(34, 4, 'So He may reward those who believe and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.'),
(34, 5, 'As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will suffer the &#761;worst&#762; torment of agonizing pain.'),
(34, 6, 'Those gifted with knowledge &#761;clearly&#762; see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord &#761;O Prophet&#762; is the truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.'),
(34, 7, 'The disbelievers say &#761;mockingly to one another&#762;, “Shall we show you a man who claims that when you have been utterly disintegrated you will be raised as a new creation?'),
(34, 8, 'Has he fabricated a lie against Allah or is he insane?” In fact, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are bound for torment and have strayed farthest &#761;from the truth&#762;.'),
(34, 9, 'Have they not then seen all that surrounds them of the heavens and the earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause &#761;deadly&#762; pieces of the sky to fall upon them. Surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns &#761;to Allah&#762;.'),
(34, 10, 'Indeed, We granted David a &#761;great&#762; privilege from Us, &#761;commanding:&#762; “O mountains! Echo his hymns! And the birds as well.” We made iron mouldable for him,'),
(34, 11, 'instructing: “Make full-length armour, &#761;perfectly&#762; balancing the links. And work righteousness &#761;O family of David!&#762;. Indeed, I am All-Seeing of what you do.”'),
(34, 12, 'And to Solomon &#761;We subjected&#762; the wind: its morning stride was a month’s journey and so was its evening stride. And We caused a stream of molten copper to flow for him, and &#761;We subjected&#762; some of the jinn to work under him by his Lord’s Will. And whoever of them deviated from Our command, We made them taste the torment of the blaze.'),
(34, 13, 'They made for him whatever he desired of sanctuaries, statues, basins as large as reservoirs, and cooking pots fixed &#761;into the ground&#762;. &#761;We ordered:&#762; “Work gratefully, O family of David!” &#761;Only&#762; a few of My servants are &#761;truly&#762; grateful.'),
(34, 14, 'When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the &#761;subjected&#762; jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff. So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had &#761;really&#762; known the unseen, they would not have remained in &#761;such&#762; humiliating servitude.'),
(34, 15, 'Indeed, there was a sign for &#761;the tribe of&#762; Sheba in their homeland: two orchards—one to the right and the other to the left. &#761;They were told:&#762; “Eat from the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him. &#761;Yours is&#762; a good land and a forgiving Lord.”'),
(34, 16, 'But they turned away. So We sent against them a devastating flood, and replaced their orchards with two others producing bitter fruit, fruitless bushes, and a few &#761;sparse&#762; thorny trees.'),
(34, 17, 'This is how We rewarded them for their ingratitude. Would We ever punish &#761;anyone in such a way&#762; except the ungrateful?'),
(34, 18, 'We had also placed between them and the cities We showered with blessings &#761;many small&#762; towns within sight of one another. And We set moderate travel distances in between, &#761;saying,&#762; “Travel between them by day and night safely.”'),
(34, 19, 'But they said, “Our Lord! Make &#761;the distances of&#762; our journeys longer,” wronging themselves. So We reduced them to &#761;cautionary&#762; tales, and scattered them utterly. Surely in this are lessons for whoever is steadfast, grateful.'),
(34, 20, 'Indeed, Iblîs’ assumption about them has come true, so they &#761;all&#762; follow him, except a group of &#761;true&#762; believers.'),
(34, 21, 'He does not have any authority over them, but &#761;Our Will is&#762; only to distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. And your Lord is a &#761;vigilant&#762; Keeper over all things.”'),
(34, 22, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Call upon those you claim &#761;to be divine&#762; besides Allah. They do not possess &#761;even&#762; an atom’s weight either in the heavens or the earth, nor do they have any share in &#761;governing&#762; them. Nor is any of them a helper to Him.”'),
(34, 23, 'No intercession will be of any benefit with Him, except by those granted permission by Him. &#761;At last,&#762; when the dread &#761;of Judgment Day&#762; is relieved from their hearts &#761;because they are permitted to intercede&#762;, they will &#761;excitedly&#762; ask &#761;the angels&#762;, “What has your Lord &#761;just&#762; said?” The angels will reply, “The truth! And He is the Most High, All-Great.”'),
(34, 24, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah! Now, certainly one of our two groups is &#761;rightly&#762; guided; the other is clearly astray.”'),
(34, 25, 'Say, “You will not be accountable for our misdeeds, nor will we be accountable for your deeds.”'),
(34, 26, 'Say, “Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.”'),
(34, 27, 'Say, “Show me those &#761;idols&#762; you have joined with Him as partners. No! In fact, He &#761;alone&#762; is Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(34, 28, 'We have sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; only as a deliverer of good news and a warner to all of humanity, but most people do not know.'),
(34, 29, 'And they ask &#761;the believers&#762;, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”'),
(34, 30, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “A Day has &#761;already&#762; been appointed for you, which you can neither delay nor advance by a &#761;single&#762; moment.”'),
(34, 31, 'The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those &#761;Scriptures&#762; before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be detained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly &#761;followers&#762; will say to the arrogant &#761;leaders&#762;, “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers.”'),
(34, 32, 'The arrogant will respond to the lowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact, you were wicked &#761;on your own&#762;.”'),
(34, 33, 'The lowly will say to the arrogant, “No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” They will &#761;all&#762; hide &#761;their&#762; remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around the necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they used to do?'),
(34, 34, 'Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, “We truly reject what you have been sent with.”'),
(34, 35, 'Adding, “We are far superior &#761;to the believers&#762; in wealth and children, and we will never be punished.”'),
(34, 36, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Surely &#761;it is&#762; my Lord &#761;Who&#762; gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.”'),
(34, 37, 'It is not your wealth or children that bring you closer to Us. But those who believe and do good—it is they who will have a multiplied reward for what they did, and they will be secure in &#761;elevated&#762; mansions.'),
(34, 38, 'As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will be confined in punishment.'),
(34, 39, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Surely &#761;it is&#762; my Lord &#761;Who&#762; gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And whatever you spend in charity, He will compensate &#761;you&#762; for it. For He is the Best Provider.”'),
(34, 40, 'And &#761;consider&#762; the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, “Was it you that these &#761;polytheists&#762; used to worship?”'),
(34, 41, 'They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they &#761;only&#762; followed the &#761;temptations of evil&#762; jinn, in whom most of them had faith.”'),
(34, 42, 'So Today neither of you can benefit or protect each other. And We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the torment of the Fire, which you used to deny.”'),
(34, 43, 'When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to worship.” They also say, “This &#761;Quran&#762; is no more than a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is nothing but pure magic.”'),
(34, 44, '&#761;They say so even though&#762; We had never given them any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before you &#761;O Prophet&#762;.'),
(34, 45, 'Those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them denied as well—and these &#761;Meccans&#762; have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given their predecessors. Yet &#761;when&#762; they denied My messengers, how severe was My response!'),
(34, 46, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I advise you to do &#761;only&#762; one thing: stand up for &#761;the sake of&#762; Allah—individually or in pairs—then reflect. Your fellow man is not insane. He is only a warner to you before &#761;the coming of&#762; a severe punishment.”'),
(34, 47, 'Say, “If I had ever asked you for a reward, you could keep it. My reward is only from Allah. And He is a Witness over all things.”'),
(34, 48, 'Say, “Surely my Lord hurls the truth &#761;against falsehood&#762;. &#761;He is&#762; the Knower of all unseen.”'),
(34, 49, 'Say, “The truth has come, and falsehood will vanish, never to return.”'),
(34, 50, 'Say, “If I am astray, the loss is only mine. And if I am guided, it is &#761;only&#762; because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed All-Hearing, Ever Near.”'),
(34, 51, 'If only you could see when they will be horrified with no escape &#761;on Judgment Day&#762;! And they will be seized from a nearby place.'),
(34, 52, 'They will &#761;then&#762; cry, “We do &#761;now&#762; believe in it &#761;all&#762;.” But how could they &#761;possibly&#762; attain faith from a place so far-off &#761;from the world&#762;,'),
(34, 53, 'while they had already rejected it before, guessing blindly from a place &#761;equally&#762; far-away &#761;from the Hereafter&#762;?'),
(34, 54, 'They will be sealed off from whatever they desire, as was done to their counterparts before. Indeed, they were &#761;all&#762; in alarming doubt.'),
(35, 1, 'All praise is for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made angels &#761;as His&#762; messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(35, 2, 'Whatever mercy Allah opens up for people, none can withhold it. And whatever He withholds, none but Him can release it. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(35, 3, 'O humanity! Remember Allah’s favours upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. How can you then be deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;?'),
(35, 4, 'If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you. And to Allah &#761;all&#762; matters will be returned &#761;for judgment&#762;.'),
(35, 5, 'O humanity! Indeed, Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah.'),
(35, 6, 'Surely Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his followers to become inmates of the Blaze.'),
(35, 7, 'Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(35, 8, 'Are those whose evil-doing is made so appealing to them that they deem it good &#761;like those who are rightly guided&#762;? &#761;It is&#762; certainly Allah &#761;Who&#762; leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides whoever He wills. So do not grieve yourself to death over them &#761;O Prophet&#762;. Surely Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.'),
(35, 9, 'And it is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up &#761;vapour, forming&#762; clouds, and then We drive them to a lifeless land, giving life to the earth after its death. Similar is the Resurrection.'),
(35, 10, 'Whoever seeks honour and power, then &#761;let them know that&#762; all honour and power belongs to Allah. To Him &#761;alone&#762; good words ascend, and righteous deeds are raised up by Him. As for those who plot evil, they will suffer a severe punishment. And the plotting of such &#761;people&#762; is doomed &#761;to fail&#762;.'),
(35, 11, 'And &#761;it is&#762; Allah &#761;Who&#762; created you from dust, then &#761;developed you&#762; from a sperm-drop, then made you into pairs. No female ever conceives or delivers without His knowledge. And no one’s life is made long or cut short but is &#761;written&#762; in a Record. That is certainly easy for Allah.'),
(35, 12, 'The two bodies of water are not alike: one is fresh, palatable, and pleasant to drink and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from them both you eat tender seafood and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships ploughing their way through both, so you may seek His bounty and give thanks &#761;to Him&#762;.'),
(35, 13, 'He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. But those &#761;idols&#762; you invoke besides Him do not possess even the skin of a date stone.'),
(35, 14, 'If you call upon them, they cannot hear your calls. And if they were to hear, they could not respond to you. On the Day of Judgment they will disown your worship &#761;of them&#762;. And no one can inform you &#761;O Prophet&#762; like the All-Knowledgeable.'),
(35, 15, 'O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(35, 16, 'If He willed, He could eliminate you and produce a new creation.'),
(35, 17, 'And that is not difficult for Allah &#761;at all&#762;.'),
(35, 18, 'No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And if a sin-burdened soul cries for help with its burden, none of it will be carried—even by a close relative. You &#761;O Prophet&#762; can only warn those who stand in awe of their Lord without seeing Him and establish prayer. Whoever purifies themselves, they only do so for their own good. And to Allah is the final return.'),
(35, 19, 'Those blind &#761;to the truth&#762; and those who can see are not equal,'),
(35, 20, 'nor are the darkness and the light,'),
(35, 21, 'nor the &#761;scorching&#762; heat and the &#761;cool&#762; shade.'),
(35, 22, 'Nor are the dead and the living equal. Indeed, Allah &#761;alone&#762; makes whoever He wills hear, but you &#761;O Prophet&#762; can never make those in the graves hear &#761;your call&#762;.'),
(35, 23, 'You are only a warner.'),
(35, 24, 'We have surely sent you with the truth as a deliverer of good news and a warner. There is no community that has not had a warner.'),
(35, 25, 'If they deny you, so did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.'),
(35, 26, 'Then I seized those who persisted in disbelief. How severe was My response!'),
(35, 27, 'Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky with which We bring forth fruits of different colours? And in the mountains are streaks of varying shades of white, red, and raven black;'),
(35, 28, 'just as people, living beings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of Allah’s servants, only the knowledgeable &#761;of His might&#762; are &#761;truly&#762; in awe of Him. Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Forgiving.'),
(35, 29, 'Surely those who recite the Book of Allah, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—&#761;can&#762; hope for an exchange that will never fail,'),
(35, 30, 'so that He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. He is truly All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.'),
(35, 31, 'The Book We have revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; is the truth, confirming what came before it. Surely Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.'),
(35, 32, 'Then We granted the Book to those We have chosen from Our servants. Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds by Allah’s Will. That is &#761;truly&#762; the greatest bounty.'),
(35, 33, 'They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk.'),
(35, 34, 'And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, Who has kept away from us all &#761;causes of&#762; sorrow. Our Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.'),
(35, 35, '&#761;He is the One&#762; Who—out of His grace—has settled us in the Home of Everlasting Stay, where we will be touched by neither fatigue nor weariness.”'),
(35, 36, 'As for the disbelievers, they will have the Fire of Hell, where they will not be &#761;allowed to be&#762; finished by death, nor will its torment be lightened for them. This is how We reward every &#761;stubborn&#762; disbeliever.'),
(35, 37, 'There they will be &#761;fervently&#762; screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out &#761;and send us back&#762;. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” &#761;They will be told,&#762; “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be mindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste &#761;the punishment&#762;, for the wrongdoers have no helper.”'),
(35, 38, 'Indeed, Allah is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He surely knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(35, 39, 'He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear &#761;the burden of&#762; their own disbelief. The disbelievers’ denial only increases them in contempt in the sight of their Lord, and it will only contribute to their loss.'),
(35, 40, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Have you considered your associate-gods which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in &#761;the creation of&#762; the heavens? Or have We given the polytheists a Book, which serves as a clear proof for them? In fact, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.”'),
(35, 41, 'Indeed, Allah &#761;alone&#762; keeps the heavens and the earth from falling apart. If they were to fall apart, none but Him could hold them up. He is truly Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.'),
(35, 42, 'They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner were to come to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other community. Yet when a warner did come to them, it only drove them farther away—'),
(35, 43, 'behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil. But evil plotting only backfires on those who plot. Are they awaiting anything but the fate of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before? You will find no change in the way of Allah, nor will you find it diverted &#761;to someone else&#762;.'),
(35, 44, 'Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them? They were far superior in might. But there is nothing that can escape Allah in the heavens or the earth. He is certainly All-Knowing, Most Capable.'),
(35, 45, 'If Allah were to punish people &#761;immediately&#762; for what they have committed, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of His servants.'),

(36, 4, 'upon the Straight Path.'),
(36, 5, '&#761;This is&#762; a revelation from the Almighty, Most Merciful,'),
(36, 6, 'so that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so are heedless.'),
(36, 7, 'The decree &#761;of torment&#762; has already been justified against most of them, for they will never believe.'),
(36, 8, '&#761;It is as if&#762; We have put shackles around their necks up to their chins, so their heads are forced up,'),
(36, 9, 'and have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and covered them &#761;all&#762; up, so they fail to see &#761;the truth&#762;.'),
(36, 10, 'It is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe.'),
(36, 11, 'You can only warn those who follow the Reminder and are in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing Him. So give them good news of forgiveness and an honourable reward.'),
(36, 12, 'It is certainly We Who resurrect the dead, and write what they send forth and what they leave behind. Everything is listed by Us in a perfect Record.'),
(36, 13, 'Give them an example &#761;O Prophet&#762; of the residents of a town, when the messengers came to them.'),
(36, 14, 'We sent them two messengers, but they rejected both. So We reinforced &#761;the two&#762; with a third, and they declared, “We have indeed been sent to you &#761;as messengers&#762;.”'),
(36, 15, 'The people replied, “You are only humans like us, and the Most Compassionate has not revealed anything. You are simply lying!”'),
(36, 16, 'The messengers responded, “Our Lord knows that we have truly been sent to you.'),
(36, 17, 'And our duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly.”'),
(36, 18, 'The people replied, “We definitely see you as a bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will certainly stone you &#761;to death&#762; and you will be touched with a painful punishment from us.”'),
(36, 19, 'The messengers said, “Your bad omen lies within yourselves. Are you saying this because you are reminded &#761;of the truth&#762;? In fact, you are a transgressing people.”'),
(36, 20, 'Then from the farthest end of the city a man came, rushing. He advised, “O my people! Follow the messengers.'),
(36, 21, 'Follow those who ask no reward of you, and are &#761;rightly&#762; guided.'),
(36, 22, 'And why should I not worship the One Who has originated me, and to Whom you will be returned.'),
(36, 23, 'How could I take besides Him other gods whose intercession would not be of any benefit to me, nor could they save me if the Most Compassionate intended to harm me?'),
(36, 24, 'Indeed, I would then be clearly astray.'),
(36, 25, 'I do believe in your Lord, so listen to me.”'),
(36, 26, '&#761;But they killed him, then&#762; he was told &#761;by the angels&#762;, “Enter Paradise!” He said, “If only my people knew'),

(36, 30, 'Oh pity, such beings! No messenger ever came to them without being mocked.'),
(36, 31, 'Have the deniers not considered how many peoples We destroyed before them who never came back to life again?'),
(36, 32, 'Yet they will all be brought before Us.'),
(36, 33, 'There is a sign for them in the dead earth: We give it life, producing grain from it for them to eat.'),
(36, 34, 'And We have placed in it gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth in it,'),
(36, 35, 'so that they may eat from its fruit, which they had no hand in making. Will they not then give thanks?'),
(36, 36, 'Glory be to the One Who created all &#761;things in&#762; pairs—&#761;be it&#762; what the earth produces, their genders, or what they do not know!'),

(36, 38, 'The sun travels for its fixed term. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.'),
(36, 39, 'As for the moon, We have ordained &#761;precise&#762; phases for it, until it ends up like an old, curved palm stalk.'),
(36, 40, 'It is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor does the night outrun the day. Each is travelling in an orbit of their own.'),
(36, 41, 'Another sign for them is that We carried their ancestors &#761;with Noah&#762; in the fully loaded Ark,'),
(36, 42, 'and created for them similar things to ride in.'),
(36, 43, 'If We willed, We could drown them: then no one would respond to their cries, nor would they be rescued—'),
(36, 44, 'except by mercy from Us, allowing them enjoyment for a &#761;little&#762; while.'),
(36, 45, '&#761;Still they turn away&#762; when it is said to them, “Beware of what is ahead of you &#761;in the Hereafter&#762; and what is behind you &#761;of destroyed nations&#762; so you may be shown mercy.”'),
(36, 46, 'Whenever a sign comes to them from their Lord, they turn away from it.'),
(36, 47, 'And when it is said to them, “Donate from what Allah has provided for you,” the disbelievers say to the believers, “Why should we feed those whom Allah could have fed if He wanted to? You are clearly astray!”'),
(36, 48, 'And they ask &#761;the believers&#762;, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”'),
(36, 49, 'They must be awaiting a single Blast, which will seize them while they are &#761;entrenched&#762; in &#761;worldly&#762; disputes.'),
(36, 50, 'Then they will not be able to make a &#761;last&#762; will, nor can they return to their own people.'),
(36, 51, 'The Trumpet will be blown &#761;a second time&#762;, then—behold!—they will rush from the graves to their Lord.'),
(36, 52, 'They will cry, “Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of rest? This must be what the Most Compassionate warned us of; the messengers told the truth!”'),
(36, 53, 'It will only take one Blast, then at once they will all be brought before Us.'),
(36, 54, 'On that Day no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be rewarded except for what you used to do.'),
(36, 55, 'Indeed, on that Day the residents of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves.'),
(36, 56, 'They and their spouses will be in &#761;cool&#762; shade, reclining on &#761;canopied&#762; couches.'),
(36, 57, 'There they will have fruits and whatever they desire.'),
(36, 58, 'And “Peace!” will be &#761;their&#762; greeting from the Merciful Lord.'),
(36, 59, '&#761;Then the disbelievers will be told,&#762; “Step away &#761;from the believers&#762; this Day, O wicked ones!'),

(39, 6, 'He created you &#761;all&#762; from a single soul, then from it He made its mate. And He produced for you four pairs of cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers &#761;in stages&#762;, one development after another, in three layers of darkness. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. How can you then be turned away?'),
(39, 7, 'If you disbelieve, then &#761;know that&#762; Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful &#761;through faith&#762;, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(39, 8, 'When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him &#761;alone&#762;. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they &#761;totally&#762; forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead &#761;others&#762; from His Way. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.”'),
(39, 9, '&#761;Are they better&#762; or those who worship &#761;their Lord&#762; devoutly in the hours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of their Lord?

(39, 20, 'But those mindful of their Lord will have &#761;elevated&#762; mansions, built one above the other, under which rivers flow. &#761;That is&#762; the promise of Allah. &#761;And&#762; Allah never fails in &#761;His&#762; promise.'),
(39, 21, 'Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it through streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various colours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces them to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason.'),
(39, 22, 'Can &#761;the misguided be like&#762; those whose hearts Allah has opened to Islam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened at the remembrance of Allah! It is they who are clearly astray.'),
(39, 23, '&#761;It is&#762; Allah &#761;Who&#762; has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect consistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin &#761;and hearts&#762; of those who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the mention of &#761;the mercy of&#762; Allah. That is the guidance of Allah, through which He guides whoever He wills. But whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.'),
(39, 24, 'Are those who will only have their &#761;bare&#762; faces to shield themselves from the awful torment on Judgment Day &#761;better than those in Paradise&#762;? It will &#761;then&#762; be said to the wrongdoers: “Reap what you sowed!”'),
(39, 25, 'Those before them &#761;also&#762; rejected &#761;the truth&#762;, then the torment came upon them from where they least expected.'),
(39, 26, 'So Allah made them taste humiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the Hereafter, if only they knew.'),

(39, 36, 'Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? Yet they threaten you with other &#761;powerless&#762; gods besides Him! Whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.'),
(39, 37, 'And whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray. Is Allah not Almighty, capable of punishment?'),
(39, 38, 'If you ask them &#761;O Prophet&#762; who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “Allah!” Ask &#761;them&#762;, “Consider then whatever &#761;idols&#762; you invoke besides Allah: if it was Allah’s Will to harm me, could they undo that harm? Or if He willed &#761;some&#762; mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him &#761;alone&#762; the faithful put their trust.”'),
(39, 39, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I &#761;too&#762; will persist in mine. You will soon come to know'),

(39, 41, 'Surely We have revealed to you the Book &#761;O Prophet&#762; with the truth for humanity. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. You are not a keeper over them.'),

Then He keeps those for whom He has ordained death, and releases the others until &#761;their&#762; appointed time. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.'),
(39, 43, 'Or have they taken others besides Allah as intercessors? Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “&#761;Would they do so,&#762; even though those &#761;idols&#762; have neither authority nor intelligence?”'),
(39, 44, 'Say, “All intercession belongs to Allah &#761;alone&#762;. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.”'),
(39, 45, 'Yet when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are filled with disgust. But as soon as those &#761;gods&#762; other than Him are mentioned, they are filled with joy.'),
(39, 46, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “O Allah—Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the seen and unseen! You will judge between Your servants regarding their differences.”'),
(39, 47, 'Even if the wrongdoers were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves from the horrible punishment on Judgment Day, for they will see from Allah what they had never expected.'),

(39, 49, 'When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us &#761;alone&#762;. Then when We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted all this only because of &#761;my&#762; knowledge.” Not at all! It is &#761;no more than&#762; a test. But most of them do not know.'),
(39, 50, 'The same had already been said by those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them, but their &#761;worldly&#762; gains were of no benefit to them.'),
(39, 51, 'So the evil &#761;consequences&#762; of their deeds overtook them. And the wrongdoers among these &#761;pagans&#762; will be overtaken by the evil &#761;consequences&#762; of their deeds. And they will have no escape.'),
(39, 52, 'Do they not know that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe.'),
(39, 53, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet, that Allah says,&#762; “O My servants who have exceeded the limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(39, 54, 'Turn to your Lord &#761;in repentance&#762;, and &#761;fully&#762; submit to Him before the punishment reaches you, &#761;for&#762; then you will not be helped.'),

(39, 57, 'Or &#761;a soul will&#762; say, ‘If only Allah had guided me, I would have certainly been one of the righteous.’'),
(39, 58, 'Or say, upon seeing the torment, ‘If only I had a second chance, I would have been one of the good-doers.’'),
(39, 59, 'Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.”'),

(39, 67, 'They have not shown Allah His proper reverence—when on the Day of Judgment the &#761;whole&#762; earth will be in His Grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;!'),
(39, 68, 'The Trumpet will be blown and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will fall dead, except those Allah wills &#761;to spare&#762;. Then it will be blown again and they will rise up at once, looking on &#761;in anticipation&#762;.'),

(39, 71, 'Those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in &#761;successive&#762; groups. When they arrive there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will ask them: “Did messengers not come to you from among yourselves, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the coming of this Day of yours?” The disbelievers will cry, “Yes &#761;indeed&#762;! But the decree of torment has come to pass against the disbelievers.”'),

Surely Allah does not guide whoever is a transgressor, a total liar.'),
(40, 29, 'O my people! Authority belongs to you today, reigning supreme in the land. But who would help us against the torment of Allah, if it were to befall us?” Pharaoh assured &#761;his people&#762;, “I am telling you only what I believe, and I am leading you only to the way of guidance.”'),

(40, 62, 'That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. How can you then be deluded &#761;from the truth&#762;?'),
(40, 63, 'This is how those who used to reject Allah’s signs were &#761;also&#762; deluded.'),
(40, 64, 'It is Allah Who made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy. He shaped you &#761;in the womb&#762;, perfecting your form. And He has provided you with what is good and lawful. That is Allah—your Lord. So Blessed is Allah, Lord of all worlds.'),
(40, 65, 'He is the Ever-Living. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. So call upon Him with sincere devotion, &#761;saying,&#762; “All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds.”'),
(40, 66, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I have been forbidden to worship those &#761;idols&#762; you worship besides Allah, since clear proofs have come to me from my Lord. And I have been commanded to &#761;fully&#762; submit to the Lord of all worlds.”'),
(40, 67, 'He is the One Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then &#761;developed you into&#762; a clinging clot &#761;of blood&#762;, then He brings you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime, and become old—though some of you &#761;may&#762; die sooner—reaching an appointed time, so perhaps you may understand &#761;Allah’s power&#762;.'),
(40, 68, 'He is the One Who gives life and causes death. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is!'),

(40, 74, 'with Allah?” They will cry, “They have &#761;all&#762; failed us. In fact, we did not invoke anything &#761;real&#762; before.” This is how Allah leaves the disbelievers to stray.'),
(40, 75, '&#761;They will be told,&#762; “This &#761;punishment&#762; is for being prideful on earth unjustly and for acting arrogantly.'),
(40, 76, 'Enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever. What an evil home for the arrogant!”'),
(40, 77, 'So be patient &#761;O Prophet&#762;. Surely Allah’s promise is true. Whether We show you some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die &#761;before that&#762;, to Us they will &#761;all&#762; be returned.'),
(40, 78, 'We already sent messengers before you. We have told you the stories of some of them, while others We have not. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s permission.

(40, 83, 'When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were prideful in whatever &#761;worldly&#762; knowledge they had, and were &#761;ultimately&#762; overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.'),

(41, 6, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I am only a man like you, &#761;but&#762; it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So take the Straight Way towards Him, and seek His forgiveness. And woe to the polytheists—'),
(41, 7, 'those who do not pay alms-tax and are in denial of the Hereafter.'),
(41, 8, '&#761;But&#762; those who believe and do good will certainly have a never-ending reward.'),

(41, 10, 'He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained &#761;all&#762; its means of sustenance—totaling four Days exactly—for all who ask.'),
(41, 11, 'Then He turned towards the heaven when it was &#761;still like&#762; smoke, saying to it and to the earth, ‘Submit, willingly or unwillingly.’ They both responded, ‘We submit willingly.’'),
(41, 12, 'So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in two Days, assigning to each its mandate. And We adorned the lowest heaven with &#761;stars like&#762; lamps &#761;for beauty&#762; and for protection. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.”'),
(41, 13, 'If they turn away, then say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I warn you of a &#761;mighty&#762; blast, like the one that befell ’&#514;d and Thamûd.”'),
(41, 14, 'The messengers had come to them from all angles, &#761;proclaiming,&#762; “Worship none but Allah.” They responded, “Had our Lord willed, He could have easily sent down angels &#761;instead&#762;. So we totally reject what you have been sent with.”'),
(41, 15, 'As for ’&#514;d, they acted arrogantly throughout the land with no right, boasting, “Who is superior to us in might?” Did they not see that Allah &#761;Himself&#762;, Who created them, was far superior to them in might? Still they persisted in denying Our signs.'),
(41, 16, 'So We sent against them a furious wind, for &#761;several&#762; miserable days, to make them taste a humiliating punishment in this worldly life. But far more humiliating will be the punishment of the Hereafter. And they will not be helped.'),
(41, 17, 'As for Thamûd, We showed them guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. So the blast of a disgracing punishment overtook them for what they used to commit.'),

(41, 21, 'They will ask their skin &#761;furiously&#762;, “Why have you testified against us?” It will say, “We have been made to speak by Allah, Who causes all things to speak. He &#761;is the One Who&#762; created you the first time, and to Him you were bound to return.'),
(41, 22, 'You did not &#761;bother to&#762; hide yourselves from your ears, eyes, and skin to prevent them from testifying against you. Rather, you assumed that Allah did not know much of what you used to do.'),
(41, 23, 'It was that &#761;false&#762; assumption you entertained about your Lord that has brought about your doom, so you have become losers.”'),
(41, 24, 'Even if they endure patiently, the Fire will &#761;always&#762; be their home. And if they &#761;beg to&#762; appease &#761;their Lord&#762;, they will never be allowed to.'),
(41, 25, 'We placed at their disposal &#761;evil&#762; associates who made their past and future &#761;misdeeds&#762; appealing to them. &#761;So&#762; the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified against them &#761;as well&#762;, &#761;for&#762; they were truly losers.'),
(41, 26, 'The disbelievers advised &#761;one another&#762;, “Do not listen to this Quran but drown it out so that you may prevail.”'),

(41, 28, 'That is the reward of Allah’s enemies: the Fire, which will be their eternal home—a &#761;fitting&#762; reward for their denial of Our revelations.'),
(41, 29, 'The disbelievers will &#761;then&#762; cry, “Our Lord! Show us those jinn and humans who led us astray: we will put them under our feet so that they will be among the lowest &#761;in Hell&#762;.”'),
(41, 30, 'Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast, the angels descend upon them, &#761;saying,&#762; “Do not fear, nor grieve. Rather, rejoice in the good news of Paradise, which you have been promised.'),

(41, 39, 'And among His signs is that you see the earth devoid of life, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir &#761;to life&#762; and swell. Indeed, the One Who revives it can easily revive the dead. He is certainly Most Capable of everything.'),
(41, 40, 'Indeed, those who abuse Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Who is better: the one who will be cast into the Fire or the one who will be secure on Judgment Day? Do whatever you want. He is certainly All-Seeing of what you do.'),

(41, 44, 'Had We revealed it as a non-Arabic Quran, they would have certainly argued, “If only its verses were made clear &#761;in our language&#762;. What! A non-Arabic revelation for an Arab audience!” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “It is a guide and a healing to the believers. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears and blindness to it &#761;in their hearts&#762;. It is as if they are being called from a faraway place.”'),
(41, 45, 'Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled &#761;at once&#762;. They are truly in alarming doubt about it.'),

(42, 8, 'Had Allah willed, He could have easily made all &#761;humanity&#762; into a single community &#761;of believers&#762;. But He admits into His mercy whoever He wills. And the wrongdoers will have no protector or helper.'),

(42, 13, 'He has ordained for you &#761;believers&#762; the Way which He decreed for Noah, and what We have revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; and what We decreed for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, &#761;commanding:&#762; “Uphold the faith, and make no divisions in it.” What you call the polytheists to is unbearable for them. Allah chooses for Himself whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns &#761;to Him&#762;.'),
(42, 14, 'They did not split &#761;into sects&#762; out of mutual envy until knowledge came to them.

There is no &#761;need for&#762; contention between us. Allah will gather us together &#761;for judgment&#762;. And to Him is the final return.”'),
(42, 16, 'As for those who dispute about Allah after He is &#761;already&#762; acknowledged &#761;by many&#762;, their argument is futile in the sight of their Lord. Upon them is wrath, and they will suffer a severe punishment.'),

They will have whatever they desire from their Lord. That is &#761;truly&#762; the greatest bounty.'),
(42, 23, 'That &#761;reward&#762; is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “I do not ask you for a reward for this &#761;message&#762;—only honour for &#761;our&#762; kinship.” Whoever earns a good deed, We will increase it in goodness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.'),
(42, 24, 'Or do they say, “He has fabricated a lie about Allah!”? &#761;If you had,&#762; Allah would have sealed your heart, if He willed. And Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. He certainly knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(42, 25, 'He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons &#761;their&#762; sins. And He knows whatever you do.'),
(42, 26, 'He responds to those who believe and do good, and increases their reward out of His grace. As for the disbelievers, they will suffer a severe punishment.'),
(42, 27, 'Had Allah given abundant provisions to &#761;all&#762; His servants, they would have certainly transgressed throughout the land. But He sends down whatever He wills in perfect measure. He is truly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.'),
(42, 28, 'He is the One Who sends down rain after people have given up hope, spreading out His mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy.'),
(42, 29, 'And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills.'),

(42, 32, 'And among His signs are the ships like mountains &#761;sailing&#762; in the sea.'),
(42, 33, 'If He wills, He can calm the wind, leaving the ships motionless on the water. Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful.'),
(42, 34, 'Or He can wreck the ships for what the people have committed—though He forgives much—'),
(42, 35, 'so those who dispute about Our signs may know that they have no refuge.'),
(42, 36, 'Whatever &#761;pleasure&#762; you have been given is &#761;no more than a fleeting&#762; enjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;'),
(42, 37, 'who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and forgive when angered;'),
(42, 38, 'who respond to their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and donate from what We have provided for them;'),

(42, 42, 'Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(42, 43, 'And whoever endures patiently and forgives—surely this is a resolve to aspire to.'),
(42, 44, 'And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back &#761;to the world&#762;?”'),
(42, 45, 'And you will see them exposed to the Fire, fully humbled out of disgrace, stealing glances &#761;at it&#762;. And the believers will say, “The &#761;true&#762; losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on Judgment Day.” The wrongdoers will certainly be in everlasting torment.'),

(42, 48, 'But if they turn away, We have not sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; as a keeper over them. Your duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762;. And indeed, when We let someone taste a mercy from Us, they become prideful &#761;because&#762; of it.

(46, 2, 'The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(46, 3, 'We only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet the disbelievers are turning away from what they have been warned about.'),
(46, 4, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Have you considered whatever &#761;idols&#762; you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in &#761;the creation of&#762; the heavens? Bring me a scripture &#761;revealed&#762; before this &#761;Quran&#762; or a shred of knowledge, if what you say is true.”'),
(46, 5, 'And who could be more astray than those who call upon others besides Allah—&#761;others&#762; that cannot respond to them until the Day of Judgment, and are &#761;even&#762; unaware of their calls?'),
(46, 6, 'And when &#761;such&#762; people will be gathered together, those &#761;gods&#762; will be their enemies and will disown their worship.'),
(46, 7, 'Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is pure magic.”'),
(46, 8, 'Or do they say, “He has fabricated this &#761;Quran&#762;!”? Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “If I have done so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from Allah. He knows best what &#761;slurs&#762; you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),
(46, 9, 'Say, “I am not the first messenger ever sent, nor do I know what will happen to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. And I am only sent with a clear warning.”'),
(46, 10, 'Ask &#761;them, O Prophet&#762;, “Consider if this &#761;Quran&#762; is &#761;truly&#762; from Allah and you deny it, and a witness from the Children of Israel attests to it and then believes, whereas you act arrogantly. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”'),
(46, 11, 'The disbelievers say of the believers, “Had it been &#761;something&#762; good, they would not have beaten us to it.” Now since they reject its guidance, they will say, “&#761;This is&#762; an ancient fabrication!”'),
(46, 12, 'And before this &#761;Quran&#762; the Book of Moses was &#761;revealed as&#762; a guide and mercy. And this Book is a confirmation, in the Arabic tongue, to warn those who do wrong, and as good news to those who do good.'),
(46, 13, 'Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast—there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.'),
(46, 14, 'It is they who will be the residents of Paradise, staying there forever, as a reward for what they used to do.'),
(46, 15, 'We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their &#761;period of&#762; bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to &#761;always&#762; be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit &#761;to Your Will&#762;.”'),
(46, 16, 'It is from these &#761;people&#762; that We will accept the good they did, and overlook their misdeeds—along with the residents of Paradise, &#761;in fulfilment of&#762; the true promise they have been given.'),
(46, 17, 'But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me that I will be brought forth &#761;from the grave&#762;, while many generations had already perished before me &#761;for good&#762;?” The parents cry to Allah for help, &#761;and warn their child,&#762; “Pity you. Have faith! Surely Allah’s promise is true.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.”'),
(46, 18, 'These are the ones against whom the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified, &#761;for&#762; they were truly losers.'),
(46, 19, 'Each &#761;of the two groups&#762; will be ranked according to what they have done so He may fully reward all. And none will be wronged.'),
(46, 20, '&#761;Watch for&#762; the Day &#761;when&#762; the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. &#761;They will be told,&#762; “You &#761;already&#762; exhausted your &#761;share of&#762; pleasures during your worldly life, and &#761;fully&#762; enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for your rebelliousness.”'),
(46, 21, 'And remember the brother of ’&#514;d, when he warned his people, who inhabited the sand-hills—there were certainly warners before and after him—&#761;saying,&#762; “Worship none but Allah. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous day.”'),
(46, 22, 'They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Bring us then whatever you threaten us with, if what you say is true.”'),
(46, 23, 'He responded, “The knowledge &#761;of its time&#762; is only with Allah. I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly.”'),
(46, 24, 'Then when they saw the torment as a &#761;dense&#762; cloud approaching their valleys, they said &#761;happily&#762;, “This is a cloud bringing us rain.” &#761;But Hûd replied,&#762; “No, it is what you sought to hasten: a &#761;fierce&#762; wind carrying a painful punishment!”'),
(46, 25, 'It destroyed everything by the command of its Lord, leaving nothing visible except their ruins. This is how We reward the wicked people.'),
(46, 26, 'Indeed, We had established them in a way We have not established you &#761;Meccans&#762;. And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither their hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever, since they persisted in denying Allah’s signs. And &#761;so&#762; they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.'),
(46, 27, 'We certainly destroyed the societies around you after having varied the signs so perhaps they would return &#761;to the Right Path&#762;.'),
(46, 28, 'Why then did those &#761;idols&#762; they took as gods—hoping to get closer &#761;to Him&#762;—not come to their aid? Instead, they failed them. That is &#761;the result of&#762; their lies and their fabrications.'),
(46, 29, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when We sent a group of jinn your way to listen to the Quran. Then, upon hearing it, they said &#761;to one another&#762;, “Listen quietly!” Then when it was over, they returned to their fellow jinn as warners.'),
(46, 30, 'They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a scripture revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and the Straight Way.'),
(46, 31, 'O our fellow jinn! Respond to the caller of Allah and believe in him, He will forgive your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.'),
(46, 32, 'And whoever does not respond to the caller of Allah will have no escape on earth, nor will they have any protectors against Him. It is they who are clearly astray.”'),
(46, 33, 'Do they not realize that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and did not tire in creating them, is able to give life to the dead? Yes &#761;indeed&#762;! He is certainly Most Capable of everything.'),
(46, 34, 'And on the Day the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, &#761;they will be asked,&#762; “Is this &#761;Hereafter&#762; not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” It will be said, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”'),
(46, 35, 'So endure patiently, as did the Messengers of Firm Resolve. And do not &#761;seek to&#762; hasten &#761;the torment&#762; for the deniers. On the Day they see what they have been threatened with, it will be as if they had only stayed &#761;in this world&#762; for an hour of a day. &#761;This is&#762; a &#761;sufficient&#762; warning! Then, will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?'),
(47, 1, 'Those who disbelieve and hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah, He will render their deeds void.'),
(47, 2, 'As for those who believe, do good, and have faith in what has been revealed to Mu&#7717;ammad—which is the truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition.'),
(47, 3, 'This is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah shows people their true state &#761;of faith&#762;.'),
(47, 4, 'So when you meet the disbelievers &#761;in battle&#762;, strike &#761;their&#762; necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later &#761;free them either as&#762; an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He &#761;Himself&#762; could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does &#761;this only to&#762; test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah, He will never render their deeds void.'),
(47, 5, 'He will guide them &#761;to their reward&#762;, improve their condition,'),
(47, 6, 'and admit them into Paradise, having made it known to them.'),
(47, 7, 'O believers! If you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your steps firm.'),
(47, 8, 'As for the disbelievers, may they be doomed and may He render their deeds void.'),
(47, 9, 'That is because they detest what Allah has revealed, so He has rendered their deeds void.'),
(47, 10, 'Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah annihilated them, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers.'),
(47, 11, 'This is because Allah is the Patron of the believers while the disbelievers have no patron.'),
(47, 12, 'Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens under which rivers flow. As for the disbelievers, they enjoy themselves and feed like cattle. But the Fire will be their home.'),
(47, 13, '&#761;Imagine, O Prophet,&#762; how many societies We destroyed that were far superior in might than your society—which drove you out—and there was none to help them!'),
(47, 14, 'Can those &#761;believers&#762; who stand on clear proof from their Lord be like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and &#761;only&#762; follow their desires?'),
(47, 15, 'The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that in it are rivers of fresh water, rivers of milk that never changes in taste, rivers of wine delicious to drink, and rivers of pure honey. There they will &#761;also&#762; have all kinds of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. &#761;Can they be&#762; like those who will stay in the Fire forever, left to drink boiling water that will tear apart their insides?'),
(47, 16, 'There are some of them who listen to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, but when they depart from you, they say &#761;mockingly&#762; to those &#761;believers&#762; gifted with knowledge, “What did he just say?” These are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed and who &#761;only&#762; follow their desires.'),
(47, 17, 'As for those who are &#761;rightly&#762; guided, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness.'),
(47, 18, 'Are they only waiting for the Hour to take them by surprise? Yet &#761;some of&#762; its signs have already come. Once it actually befalls them, will it not be too late to be mindful?'),
(47, 19, 'So, know &#761;well, O Prophet,&#762; that there is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Allah. And seek forgiveness for your shortcomings and for &#761;the sins of&#762; the believing men and women. For Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows your movements and places of rest &#761;O people&#762;.'),
(47, 20, 'And the believers say, “If only a sûrah was revealed &#761;allowing self-defence&#762;!” Yet when a precise sûrah is revealed, in which fighting is &#761;explicitly&#762; mentioned, you see those with sickness in their hearts staring at you like someone in the throes of death. It would have been better for them'),
(47, 21, 'to obey and speak rightly. Then when fighting was ordained, it surely would have been better for them if they were true to Allah.'),
(47, 22, 'Now if you &#761;hypocrites&#762; turn away, perhaps you would then spread corruption throughout the land and sever your &#761;ties of&#762; kinship!'),
(47, 23, 'These are the ones who Allah has condemned, deafening them and blinding their eyes.'),
(47, 24, 'Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts?'),
(47, 25, 'Indeed, those who relapse &#761;into disbelief&#762; after &#761;true&#762; guidance has become clear to them, &#761;it is&#762; Satan &#761;that&#762; has tempted them, luring them with false hopes.'),
(47, 26, 'That is because they said &#761;privately&#762; to those who &#761;also&#762; detest what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.” But Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows what they are hiding.'),
(47, 27, 'Then how &#761;horrible&#762; will it be when the angels take their souls, beating their faces and backs!'),
(47, 28, 'This is because they follow whatever displeases Allah and hate whatever pleases Him, so He has rendered their deeds void.'),
(47, 29, 'Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that Allah will not &#761;be able to&#762; expose their malice?'),
(47, 30, 'Had We willed, We could have truly shown them to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, and you would have certainly recognized them by their appearance. But you will surely recognize them by their tone of speech. And Allah &#761;fully&#762; knows your doings &#761;O people&#762;.'),
(47, 31, 'We will certainly test you &#761;believers&#762; until We prove those of you who &#761;truly&#762; struggle &#761;in Allah’s cause&#762; and remain steadfast, and reveal how you conduct yourselves.'),
(47, 32, 'Indeed, those who disbelieve, hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah, and defy the Messenger after &#761;true&#762; guidance has become clear to them; they will not harm Allah in the least, but He will render their deeds void.'),
(47, 33, 'O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not let your deeds be in vain.'),
(47, 34, 'Surely those who disbelieve, hinder &#761;others&#762; from the Way of Allah, and then die as disbelievers; Allah will never forgive them.'),
(47, 35, 'So do not falter or cry for peace, for you will have the upper hand and Allah is with you. And He will never let your deeds go to waste.'),
(47, 36, 'This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are faithful and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, He will grant you your &#761;full&#762; reward, and will not ask you &#761;to donate all&#762; your wealth.'),
(47, 37, 'If He were to do so and pressure you, you would withhold and He would bring out your resentment.'),
(47, 38, 'Here you are, being invited to donate &#761;a little&#762; in the cause of Allah. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need &#761;of Him&#762;. If you &#761;still&#762; turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you.'),
(48, 1, 'Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph &#761;O Prophet&#762;'),
(48, 2, 'so that Allah may forgive you for your past and future shortcomings, perfect His favour upon you, guide you along the Straight Path,'),
(48, 3, 'and so that Allah will help you tremendously.'),
(48, 4, 'He is the One Who sent down serenity upon the hearts of the believers so that they may increase even more in their faith. To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(48, 5, 'So He may admit believing men and women into Gardens under which rivers flow—to stay there forever—and absolve them of their sins. And that is a supreme achievement in the sight of Allah.'),
(48, 6, 'Also &#761;so that&#762; He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, who harbour evil thoughts of Allah. May ill-fate befall them! Allah is displeased with them. He has condemned them and prepared for them Hell. What an evil destination!'),
(48, 7, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(48, 8, 'Indeed, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; We have sent you as a witness, a deliverer of good news, and a warner,'),
(48, 9, 'so that you &#761;believers&#762; may have faith in Allah and His Messenger, support and honour him, and glorify Allah morning and evening.'),
(48, 10, 'Surely those who pledge allegiance to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. Allah’s Hand is over theirs. Whoever breaks their pledge, it will only be to their own loss. And whoever fulfils their pledge to Allah, He will grant them a great reward.'),
(48, 11, 'The nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, will say to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who then can stand between you and Allah in any way, if He intends harm or benefit for you? In fact, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(48, 12, 'The truth is: you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families again. And that was made appealing in your hearts. You harboured evil thoughts &#761;about Allah&#762;, and &#761;so&#762; became a doomed people.”'),
(48, 13, 'And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We surely have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire.'),
(48, 14, 'To Allah &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(48, 15, 'Those who stayed behind will say, when you &#761;believers&#762; set out to take the spoils of war, “Let us accompany you.” They wish to change Allah’s promise. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “You will not accompany us. This is what Allah has said before.” They will then say, “In fact, you are driven by jealousy against us!” The truth is: they can hardly comprehend.'),
(48, 16, 'Say to nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, “You will be called &#761;to fight&#762; against a people of great might, who you will fight unless they submit. If you then obey, Allah will grant you a fine reward. But if you turn away as you did before, He will inflict upon you a painful punishment.”'),
(48, 17, 'There is no blame on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick &#761;for staying behind&#762;. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away will be subjected by Him to a painful punishment.'),
(48, 18, 'Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down serenity upon them and rewarded them with a victory at hand,'),
(48, 19, 'and many spoils of war they will gain. For Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(48, 20, 'Allah has promised you &#761;believers&#762; abundant spoils, which you will gain, so He hastened this &#761;truce&#762; for you. And He has held people’s hands back from &#761;harming&#762; you, so it may be a sign for the believers, and so He may guide you along the Straight Path.'),
(48, 21, 'And &#761;there are&#762; other gains which are beyond your reach that Allah is keeping in store &#761;for you&#762;. For Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(48, 22, 'If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would certainly flee. Then they would never find any protector or helper.'),
(48, 23, '&#761;This is&#762; Allah’s way, already long established &#761;in the past&#762;. And you will find no change in Allah’s way.'),
(48, 24, 'He is the One Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of &#761;&#7716;udaibiyah, near&#762; Mecca, after giving you the upper hand over &#761;a group of&#762; them. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(48, 25, 'They are the ones who persisted in disbelief and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, preventing the sacrificial animals from reaching their destination. &#761;We would have let you march through Mecca,&#762; had there not been believing men and women, unknown to you. You might have trampled them underfoot, incurring guilt for &#761;what you did to&#762; them unknowingly. That was so Allah may admit into His mercy whoever He wills. Had those &#761;unknown&#762; believers stood apart, We would have certainly inflicted a painful punishment on the disbelievers.'),
(48, 26, '&#761;Remember&#762; when the disbelievers had filled their hearts with pride—the pride of &#761;pre-Islamic&#762; ignorance—then Allah sent down His serenity upon His Messenger and the believers, inspiring them to uphold the declaration of faith, for they were better entitled and more worthy of it. And Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(48, 27, 'Indeed, Allah will fulfil His Messenger’s vision in all truth: Allah willing, you will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, in security—&#761;some with&#762; heads shaved and &#761;others with&#762; hair shortened—without fear. He knew what you did not know, so He first granted you the triumph at hand.'),
(48, 28, 'He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with &#761;right&#762; guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others. And sufficient is Allah as a Witness.'),
(48, 29, 'Mu&#7717;ammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm with the disbelievers and compassionate with one another. You see them bowing and prostrating &#761;in prayer&#762;, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure. The sign &#761;of brightness can be seen&#762; on their faces from the trace of prostrating &#761;in prayer&#762;. This is their description in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its &#761;tiny&#762; branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters—in this way Allah makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers. To those of them who believe and do good, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(49, 1, 'O believers! Do not proceed &#761;in any matter&#762; before &#761;a decree from&#762; Allah and His Messenger. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.'),
(49, 2, 'O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you do to one another, or your deeds will become void while you are unaware.'),
(49, 3, 'Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of Allah’s Messenger are the ones whose hearts Allah has refined for righteousness. They will have forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(49, 4, 'Indeed, most of those who call out to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; from outside &#761;your&#762; private quarters have no understanding &#761;of manners&#762;.'),
(49, 5, 'Had they been patient until you could come out to them, it would have certainly been better for them. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(49, 6, 'O believers, if an evildoer brings you any news, verify &#761;it&#762; so you do not harm people unknowingly, becoming regretful for what you have done.'),
(49, 7, 'And keep in mind that Allah’s Messenger is &#761;still&#762; in your midst. If he were to yield to you in many matters, you would surely suffer &#761;the consequences&#762;. But Allah has endeared faith to you, making it appealing in your hearts. And He has made disbelief, rebelliousness, and disobedience detestable to you. Those are the ones rightly guided.'),
(49, 8, '&#761;This is&#762; a bounty and a blessing from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(49, 9, 'And if two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them. But if one of them transgresses against the other, then fight against the transgressing group until they &#761;are willing to&#762; submit to the rule of Allah. If they do so, then make peace between both &#761;groups&#762; in all fairness and act justly. Surely Allah loves those who uphold justice.'),
(49, 10, 'The believers are but one brotherhood, so make peace between your brothers. And be mindful of Allah so you may be shown mercy.'),
(49, 11, 'O believers! Do not let some &#761;men&#762; ridicule others, they may be better than them, nor let &#761;some&#762; women ridicule other women, they may be better than them. Do not defame one another, nor call each other by offensive nicknames. How evil it is to act rebelliously after having faith! And whoever does not repent, it is they who are the &#761;true&#762; wrongdoers.'),
(49, 12, 'O believers! Avoid many suspicions, &#761;for&#762; indeed, some suspicions are sinful. And do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of their dead brother? You would despise that! And fear Allah. Surely Allah is &#761;the&#762; Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.'),
(49, 13, 'O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may &#761;get to&#762; know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware.'),
(49, 14, '&#761;Some of&#762; the nomadic Arabs say, “We believe.” Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “You have not believed. But say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger &#761;wholeheartedly&#762;, He will not discount anything from &#761;the reward of&#762; your deeds. Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”'),

(57, 12, 'On that Day you will see believing men and women with their light shining ahead of them and on their right. &#761;They will be told,&#762; “Today you have good news of Gardens, under which rivers flow, &#761;for you&#762; to stay in forever. This is &#761;truly&#762; the ultimate triumph.”'),
(57, 13, 'On that Day hypocrite men and women will beg the believers, “Wait for us so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said &#761;mockingly&#762;, “Go back &#761;to the world&#762; and seek a light &#761;there&#762;!” Then a &#761;separating&#762; wall with a gate will be erected between them. On the near side will be grace and on the far side will be torment.'),
(57, 14, 'The tormented will cry out to those graced, “Were we not with you?” They will reply, “Yes &#761;you were&#762;. But you chose to be tempted &#761;by hypocrisy&#762;, &#761;eagerly&#762; awaited &#761;our demise&#762;, doubted &#761;the truth&#762;, and were deluded by false hopes until Allah’s decree &#761;of your death&#762; came to pass. And &#761;so&#762; the Chief Deceiver deceived you about Allah.'),
(57, 15, 'So Today no ransom will be accepted from you &#761;hypocrites&#762;, nor from the disbelievers. Your home is the Fire—it is the &#761;only&#762; fitting place for you. What an evil destination!”'),
(57, 16, 'Has the time not yet come for believers’ hearts to be humbled at the remembrance of Allah and what has been revealed of the truth, and not be like those given the Scripture before—&#761;those&#762; who were spoiled for so long that their hearts became hardened. And many of them are &#761;still&#762; rebellious.'),
(57, 17, 'Know that Allah revives the earth after its death. We have certainly made the signs clear for you so perhaps you will understand.'),
(57, 18, 'Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a good loan will have it multiplied for them, and they will have an honourable reward.'),
(57, 19, '&#761;As for&#762; those who believe in Allah and His messengers, it is they who are &#761;truly&#762; the people of truth. And the martyrs, with their Lord, will have their reward and their light. But &#761;as for&#762; those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, it is they who will be the residents of the Hellfire.'),
(57, 20, 'Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.'),
(57, 21, '&#761;So&#762; compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.'),
(57, 22, 'No calamity &#761;or blessing&#762; occurs on earth or in yourselves without being &#761;written&#762; in a Record before We bring it into being. This is certainly easy for Allah.'),
(57, 23, '&#761;We let you know this&#762; so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful—'),
(57, 24, 'those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people. And whoever turns away &#761;should know that&#762; Allah &#761;alone&#762; is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(57, 25, 'Indeed, We sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and with them We sent down the Scripture and the balance &#761;of justice&#762; so that people may administer justice. And We sent down iron with its great might, benefits for humanity, and means for Allah to prove who &#761;is willing to&#762; stand up for Him and His messengers without seeing Him. Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.'),
(57, 26, 'And indeed, We sent Noah and Abraham and reserved prophethood and revelation for their descendants. Some of them are &#761;rightly&#762; guided, while most are rebellious.'),
(57, 27, 'Then in the footsteps of these &#761;prophets&#762;, We sent Our messengers, and &#761;after them&#762; We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and granted him the Gospel, and instilled compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only seeking to please Allah, yet they did not &#761;even&#762; observe it strictly. So We rewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious.'),
(57, 28, 'O people of faith! Fear Allah and believe in His Messenger. &#761;And&#762; He will grant you a double share of His mercy, provide you with a light to walk in &#761;on Judgment Day&#762;, and forgive you. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(57, 29, '&#761;This is so&#762; that the People of the Book &#761;who deny the Prophet&#762; may know that they do not have any control over Allah’s grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s Hands. He grants it to whoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.'),
(58, 1, 'Indeed, Allah has heard the argument of the woman who pleaded with you &#761;O Prophet&#762; concerning her husband, and appealed to Allah. Allah has heard your exchange. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.'),
(58, 2, 'Those of you who &#761;sinfully&#762; divorce their wives by comparing them to their mothers &#761;should know that&#762; their wives are in no way their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them. What they say is certainly detestable and false. Yet Allah is truly Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.'),
(58, 3, 'Those who divorce their wives in this manner, then &#761;wish to&#762; retract what they said, must free a slave before they touch each other. This &#761;penalty&#762; is meant to deter you. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(58, 4, 'But if the husband cannot afford this, let him then fast two consecutive months before the couple touch each other. But if he is unable &#761;to fast&#762;, then let him feed sixty poor people. This is to re-affirm your faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(58, 5, 'Indeed, those who defy Allah and His Messenger will be debased, just like those before them. We have certainly sent down clear revelations. And the disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment.'),
(58, 6, 'On the Day Allah resurrects them all together, He will then inform them of what they have done. Allah has kept account of it all, while they have forgotten it. For Allah is a Witness over all things.'),
(58, 7, 'Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? If three converse privately, He is their fourth. If five, He is their sixth. Whether fewer or more, He is with them wherever they may be. Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will inform them of what they have done. Surely Allah has &#761;perfect&#762; knowledge of all things.'),
(58, 8, 'Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret talks, yet they &#761;always&#762; return to what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin, aggression, and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, they greet you not as Allah greets you, and say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them—they will burn in it. And what an evil destination!'),
(58, 9, 'O believers! When you converse privately, let it not be for sin, aggression, or disobedience to the Messenger, but let it be for goodness and righteousness. And fear Allah, to Whom you will &#761;all&#762; be gathered.'),
(58, 10, 'Secret talks are only inspired by Satan to grieve the believers. Yet he cannot harm them whatsoever except by Allah’s Will. So in Allah let the believers put their trust.'),
(58, 11, 'O believers! When you are told to make room in gatherings, then do so. Allah will make room for you &#761;in His grace&#762;. And if you are told to rise, then do so. Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and &#761;raise&#762; those gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(58, 12, 'O believers! When you consult the Messenger privately, give something in charity before your consultation. That is better and purer for you. But if you lack the means, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(58, 13, 'Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations &#761;with him&#762;? Since you are unable to do so, and Allah has turned to you in mercy, then &#761;continue to&#762; establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(58, 14, 'Have you not seen those &#761;hypocrites&#762; who ally themselves with a people with whom Allah is displeased? They are neither with you nor with them. And they swear to lies knowingly.'),
(58, 15, 'Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Evil indeed is what they do.'),
(58, 16, 'They have made their &#761;false&#762; oaths as a shield, hindering &#761;others&#762; from the cause of Allah. So they will suffer a humiliating punishment.'),
(58, 17, 'Neither their wealth nor children will be of any help to them against Allah whatsoever. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.'),
(58, 18, 'On the Day Allah resurrects them all, they will &#761;falsely&#762; swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking they have something to stand on. Indeed, it is they who are the &#761;total&#762; liars.'),
(58, 19, 'Satan has taken hold of them, causing them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Satan. Surely Satan’s party is bound to lose.'),
(58, 20, '&#761;As for&#762; those who defy Allah and His Messenger, they will definitely be among the most debased.'),
(58, 21, 'Allah has decreed, “I and My messengers will certainly prevail.” Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.'),
(58, 22, 'You will never find a people who &#761;truly&#762; believe in Allah and the Last Day loyal to those who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those &#761;believers&#762;, Allah has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed.'),
(59, 1, 'Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies Allah. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(59, 2, 'He is the One Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book from their homes for &#761;their&#762; first banishment &#761;ever&#762;. You never thought they would go. And they thought their strongholds would put them out of Allah’s reach. But &#761;the decree of&#762; Allah came upon them from where they never expected. And He cast horror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson &#761;from this&#762;, O people of insight!'),
(59, 3, 'Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have certainly punished them in this world. And in the Hereafter they will suffer the punishment of the Fire.'),
(59, 4, 'This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah, then Allah is truly severe in punishment.'),
(59, 5, 'Whatever palm trees you &#761;believers&#762; cut down or left standing intact, it was &#761;all&#762; by Allah’s Will, so that He might disgrace the rebellious.'),
(59, 6, 'As for the gains Allah has turned over to His Messenger from them—you did not &#761;even&#762; spur on any horse or camel for such gains. But Allah gives authority to His messengers over whoever He wills. For Allah is Most Capable of everything.'),
(59, 7, 'As for gains granted by Allah to His Messenger from the people of &#761;other&#762; lands, they are for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and &#761;needy&#762; travellers so that wealth may not merely circulate among your rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatever he forbids you from, leave it. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.'),
(59, 8, '&#761;Some of the gains will be&#762; for poor emigrants who were driven out of their homes and wealth, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure, and standing up for Allah and His Messenger. They are the ones true in faith.'),
(59, 9, 'As for those who had settled in the city and &#761;embraced&#762; the faith before &#761;the arrival of&#762; the emigrants, they love whoever immigrates to them, never having a desire in their hearts for whatever &#761;of the gains&#762; is given to the emigrants. They give &#761;the emigrants&#762; preference over themselves even though they may be in need. And whoever is saved from the selfishness of their own souls, it is they who are &#761;truly&#762; successful.'),
(59, 10, 'And those who come after them will pray, “Our Lord! Forgive us and our fellow believers who preceded us in faith, and do not allow bitterness into our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord! Indeed, You are Ever Gracious, Most Merciful.”'),
(59, 11, 'Have you &#761;O Prophet&#762; not seen the hypocrites who say to their fellow disbelievers from the People of the Book, “If you are expelled, we will certainly leave with you, and We will never obey anyone against you. And if you are fought against, we will surely help you.”? But Allah bears witness that they are truly liars.'),
(59, 12, 'Indeed, if they are expelled, the hypocrites will never leave with them. And if they are fought against, the hypocrites will never help them. And even if the hypocrites did so, they would certainly flee, then the disbelievers would be left with no help.'),
(59, 13, 'Indeed, there is more fear in their hearts for you &#761;believers&#762; than for Allah. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend.'),
(59, 14, 'Even united, they would not &#761;dare&#762; fight against you except &#761;from&#762; within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. Their malice for each other is intense: you think they are united, yet their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people with no &#761;real&#762; understanding.'),
(59, 15, 'They are &#761;both just&#762; like those who recently went down before them: they tasted the evil consequences of their doings. And they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(59, 16, '&#761;They are&#762; like Satan when he lures someone to disbelieve. Then after they have done so, he will say &#761;on Judgment Day&#762;, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I truly fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.”'),
(59, 17, 'So they will both end up in the Fire, staying there forever. That is the reward of the wrongdoers.'),
(59, 18, 'O believers! Be mindful of Allah and let every soul look to what &#761;deeds&#762; it has sent forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah, &#761;for&#762; certainly Allah is All-Aware of what you do.'),
(59, 19, 'And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. It is they who are &#761;truly&#762; rebellious.'),
(59, 20, 'The residents of the Fire cannot be equal to the residents of Paradise. &#761;Only&#762; the residents of Paradise will be successful.'),
(59, 21, 'Had We sent down this Quran upon a mountain, you would have certainly seen it humbled and torn apart in awe of Allah. We set forth such comparisons for people, &#761;so&#762; perhaps they may reflect.'),
(59, 22, 'He is Allah—there is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him: Knower of the seen and unseen. He is the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.'),
(59, 23, 'He is Allah—there is no god except Him: the King, the Most Holy, the All-Perfect, the Source of Serenity, the Watcher &#761;of all&#762;, the Almighty, the Supreme in Might, the Majestic. Glorified is Allah far above what they associate with Him &#761;in worship&#762;!'),
(59, 24, 'He is Allah: the Creator, the Inventor, the Shaper. He &#761;alone&#762; has the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth &#761;constantly&#762; glorifies Him. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.'),
(60, 1, 'O believers! Do not take My enemies and yours as trusted allies, showing them affection even though they deny what has come to you of the truth. They drove the Messenger and yourselves out &#761;of Mecca&#762;, simply for your belief in Allah, your Lord. If you &#761;truly&#762; emigrated to struggle in My cause and seek My pleasure, &#761;then do not take them as allies,&#762; disclosing secrets &#761;of the believers&#762; to the pagans out of affection for them, when I know best whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. And whoever of you does this has truly strayed from the Right Way.'),
(60, 2, 'If they gain the upper hand over you, they would be your &#761;open&#762; enemies, unleashing their hands and tongues to harm you, and wishing that you would abandon faith.'),
(60, 3, 'Neither your relatives nor children will benefit you on Judgment Day—He will decide between you &#761;all&#762;. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.'),
(60, 4, 'You already have an excellent example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We totally dissociate ourselves from you and &#761;shun&#762; whatever &#761;idols&#762; you worship besides Allah. We reject you. The enmity and hatred that has arisen between us and you will last until you believe in Allah alone.” The only exception is when Abraham said to his father, “I will seek forgiveness for you,&#761;” adding, “but&#762; I cannot protect you from Allah at all.” &#761;The believers prayed,&#762; “Our Lord! In You we trust. And to You we &#761;always&#762; turn. And to You is the final return.'),
(60, 5, 'Our Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the disbelievers. Forgive us, our Lord! You &#761;alone&#762; are truly the Almighty, All-Wise.”'),
(60, 6, 'You certainly have an excellent example in them for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day. But whoever turns away, then surely Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(60, 7, '&#761;In time,&#762; Allah may bring about goodwill between you and those of them you &#761;now&#762; hold as enemies. For Allah is Most Capable. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(60, 8, 'Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are fair.'),
(60, 9, 'Allah only forbids you from befriending those who have fought you for &#761;your&#762; faith, driven you out of your homes, or supported &#761;others&#762; in doing so. And whoever takes them as friends, then it is they who are the &#761;true&#762; wrongdoers.'),
(60, 10, 'O believers! When the believing women come to you as emigrants, test their intentions—their faith is best known to Allah—and if you find them to be believers, then do not send them back to the disbelievers. These &#761;women&#762; are not lawful &#761;wives&#762; for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful &#761;husbands&#762; for them. &#761;But&#762; repay the disbelievers whatever &#761;dowries&#762; they had paid. And there is no blame on you if you marry these &#761;women&#762; as long as you pay them their dowries. And do not hold on to marriage with polytheistic women. &#761;But&#762; demand &#761;repayment of&#762; whatever &#761;dowries&#762; you had paid, and let the disbelievers do the same. That is the judgment of Allah—He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(60, 11, 'And if any of your wives desert you to the disbelievers, and later you take spoils from them, then pay those whose wives have gone, the equivalent of whatever &#761;dowry&#762; they had paid. And be mindful of Allah, in Whom you believe.'),
(60, 12, 'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will neither associate anything with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor falsely attribute &#761;illegitimate&#762; children to their husbands, nor disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge, and ask Allah to forgive them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(60, 13, 'O believers! Do not ally yourselves with a people Allah is displeased with. They already have no hope for the Hereafter, just like the disbelievers lying in &#761;their&#762; graves.'),

(61, 5, '&#761;Remember, O Prophet,&#762; when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me when you already know I am Allah’s messenger to you?” So when they &#761;persistently&#762; deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.'),
(61, 6, 'And &#761;remember&#762; when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel! I am truly Allah’s messenger to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving good news of a messenger after me whose name will be A&#7717;mad.” Yet when the Prophet came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is pure magic.”'),

(61, 13, '&#761;He will also give you&#762; another favour that you long for: help from Allah and an imminent victory. &#761;So&#762; give good news &#761;O Prophet&#762; to the believers.'),
(61, 14, 'O believers! Stand up for Allah, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah.” Then a group from the Children of Israel believed while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed.'),

(64, 5, 'Have the stories of those who disbelieved before not reached you &#761;pagans&#762;? They tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and they will suffer a painful punishment.'),
(64, 6, 'That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said &#761;mockingly&#762;, “How can humans be our guides?” So they persisted in disbelief and turned away. And Allah was not in need &#761;of their faith&#762;. For Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.'),
(64, 7, 'The disbelievers claim they will not be resurrected. Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected, then you will certainly be informed of what you have done. And that is easy for Allah.”'),

(65, 1, 'O Prophet! &#761;Instruct the believers:&#762; When you &#761;intend to&#762; divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period, and count it accurately. And fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever transgresses Allah’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change &#761;of heart&#762; later.'),
(65, 2, 'Then when they have &#761;almost&#762; reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or separate from them honourably. And call two of your reliable men to witness &#761;either way&#762;—and &#761;let the witnesses&#762; bear true testimony for &#761;the sake of&#762; Allah. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make a way out for them,'),
(65, 3, 'and provide for them from sources they could never imagine. And whoever puts their trust in Allah, then He &#761;alone&#762; is sufficient for them. Certainly Allah achieves His Will. Allah has already set a destiny for everything.'),
(65, 4, 'As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, and those who have not menstruated as well. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.'),
(65, 5, 'This is the commandment of Allah, which He has revealed to you. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will absolve them of their sins and reward them immensely.'),
(65, 6, 'Let them live where you live &#761;during their waiting period&#762;, according to your means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable. If they are pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. And if they nurse your child, compensate them, and consult together courteously. But if you fail to reach an agreement, then another woman will nurse &#761;the child&#762; for the father.'),
(65, 7, 'Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has given him. Allah does not require of any soul beyond what He has given it. After hardship, Allah will bring about ease.'),
(65, 8, '&#761;Imagine&#762; how many societies rebelled against the commandments of their Lord and His messengers, so We called each &#761;society&#762; to a severe account and subjected them to a horrible punishment.'),
(65, 9, 'So they tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and the outcome of their doings was &#761;total&#762; loss.'),
(65, 10, 'Allah has &#761;also&#762; prepared for them a severe punishment. So fear Allah, O people of reason and faith. Allah has indeed revealed to you a Reminder,'),
(65, 11, '&#761;and sent&#762; a messenger reciting to you Allah’s revelations, making things clear so that He may bring those who believe and do good out of darkness and into light. And whoever believes in Allah and does good will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah will have indeed granted them an excellent provision.'),
(65, 12, 'Allah is the One Who created seven heavens &#761;in layers&#762;, and likewise for the earth. The &#761;divine&#762; command descends between them so you may know that Allah is Most Capable of everything and that Allah certainly encompasses all things in &#761;His&#762; knowledge.'),
(66, 1, 'O Prophet! Why do you prohibit &#761;yourself&#762; from what Allah has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'),
(66, 2, 'Allah has already ordained for you &#761;believers&#762; the way to absolve yourselves from your oaths. For Allah is your Guardian. And He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.'),
(66, 3, '&#761;Remember&#762; when the Prophet had &#761;once&#762; confided something to one of his wives, then when she disclosed it &#761;to another wife&#762; and Allah made it known to him, he presented &#761;to her&#762; part of what was disclosed and overlooked a part. So when he informed her of it, she exclaimed, “Who told you this?” He replied, “I was informed by the All-Knowing, All-Aware.”'),
(66, 4, '&#761;It will be better&#762; if you &#761;wives&#762; both turn to Allah in repentance, for your hearts have certainly faltered. But if you &#761;continue to&#762; collaborate against him, then &#761;know that&#762; Allah Himself is his Guardian. And Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels are &#761;all&#762; his supporters as well.'),
(66, 5, 'Perhaps, if he were to divorce you &#761;all&#762;, his Lord would replace you with better wives who are submissive &#761;to Allah&#762;, faithful &#761;to Him&#762;, devout, repentant, dedicated to worship and fasting—previously married or virgins.'),
(66, 6, 'O believers! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, overseen by formidable and severe angels, who never disobey whatever Allah orders—always doing as commanded.'),
(66, 7, '&#761;The deniers will then be told,&#762; “O disbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! You are only rewarded for what you used to do.”'),
(66, 8, 'O believers! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance, so your Lord may absolve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens, under which rivers flow, on the Day Allah will not disgrace the Prophet or the believers with him. Their light will shine ahead of them and on their right. They will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us. &#761;For&#762; You are truly Most Capable of everything.”'),
(66, 9, 'O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination!'),
(66, 10, 'Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. Each was married to one of Our righteous servants, yet betrayed them. So their husbands were of no benefit to them against Allah whatsoever. Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!”'),
(66, 11, 'And Allah sets forth an example for the believers: the wife of Pharaoh, who prayed, “My Lord! Build me a house in Paradise near You, deliver me from Pharaoh and his &#761;evil&#762; doing, and save me from the wrongdoing people.”'),
(66, 12, '&#761;There is&#762; also &#761;the example of&#762; Mary, the daughter of ’Imrân, who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her &#761;womb&#762; through Our angel &#761;Gabriel&#762;. She testified to the words of her Lord and His Scriptures, and was one of the &#761;sincerely&#762; devout.'),

(67, 3, '&#761;He is the One&#762; Who created seven heavens, one above the other. You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate. So look again: do you see any flaws?'),
(67, 4, 'Then look again and again—your sight will return frustrated and weary.'),
(67, 5, 'And indeed, We adorned the lowest heaven with &#761;stars like&#762; lamps, and made them &#761;as missiles&#762; for stoning &#761;eavesdropping&#762; devils, for whom We have also prepared the torment of the Blaze.'),

(67, 9, 'They will reply, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.’”'),
(67, 10, 'And they will lament, “If only we had listened and reasoned, we would not be among the residents of the Blaze!”'),
(67, 11, 'And so they will confess their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze!'),
(67, 12, 'Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him will have forgiveness and a mighty reward.'),
(67, 13, 'Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is &#761;hidden&#762; in the heart.'),
(67, 14, 'How could He not know His Own creation? For He &#761;alone&#762; is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.'),

(67, 19, 'Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything.'),
(67, 20, 'Also, which &#761;powerless&#762; force will come to your help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are only &#761;lost&#762; in delusion.'),
(67, 21, 'Or who is it that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion &#761;to the truth&#762;.'),

(67, 27, 'Then when they see the torment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and it will be said &#761;to them&#762;, “This is what you claimed would never come.”'),
(67, 28, 'Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”'),
